# SprintLite

## Overview

SprintLite is a lightweight task management web application designed to help small teams create, assign, and track tasks through a simple workflow. The project is built as a simulated industry-style team project, following clean architecture, defined roles, and a production-oriented tech stack.

The goal of SprintLite is not to replicate a full-scale enterprise tool like Jira, but to demonstrate **core engineering fundamentals**: frontend–backend integration, database design, caching, cloud deployment, and collaborative development practices.

---

## Key Objectives

* Build a real, usable web application
* Work as a team with defined responsibilities
* Use industry-relevant technologies mandated by the module
* Keep the system simple, understandable, and finishable

---

## Core Features (Version 1)

### Authentication

* User signup
* User login
* Session-based authentication

### Task Management

* Create tasks
* Assign tasks to users
* Update task status

### DAY 12 - MOHIT
## Zod Schema Validation & Request Validation

### 📋 Overview

Implemented full-stack request validation using Zod. All POST/PUT handlers now parse and validate input with shared schemas, returning structured errors through the response handler.

**Key Benefits**
- ✅ Type-safe runtime validation with clear messages
- ✅ Reusable schemas across client/server
- ✅ Less boilerplate in routes (schema.parse replaces manual checks)
- ✅ Consistent error envelope with codes and field details
- ✅ Custom refinements for business rules (e.g., future due dates)

---

### 📂 Schema Files
- [lib/schemas/userSchema.js](lib/schemas/userSchema.js)
- [lib/schemas/taskSchema.js](lib/schemas/taskSchema.js)
- [lib/schemas/commentSchema.js](lib/schemas/commentSchema.js)

**Response Helper**
- [lib/responseHandler.js](lib/responseHandler.js) — added `handleZodError()` to standardize validation failures

---

### 🛠 Core Schemas (Highlights)

**User (createUserSchema)** — email, name (2-100 chars), strong password (8+ with upper/lower/number), role enum, optional avatar URL.

**User (updateUserSchema)** — partial update, same rules, requires at least one field.

**Task (createTaskSchema)** — title (3-200), optional description (<=2000), status enum, priority enum, creatorId UUID, optional assigneeId UUID, optional future dueDate.

**Task (updateTaskSchema)** — partial update, same enums and UUID checks, dueDate optional.

**Comment (createCommentSchema)** — content 1-1000 chars, no whitespace-only, taskId/userId UUIDs.

**Comment (updateCommentSchema)** — content 1-1000 chars, no whitespace-only.

Query schemas also validate `page`, `limit`, filters, sort fields for users, tasks, comments.

---

### 🔗 Routes Using Zod
- [app/api/users/route.js](app/api/users/route.js) — POST (createUserSchema), GET query (userQuerySchema)
- [app/api/users/[id]/route.js](app/api/users/[id]/route.js) — PUT (updateUserSchema)
- [app/api/tasks/route.js](app/api/tasks/route.js) — POST (createTaskSchema)
- [app/api/tasks/[id]/route.js](app/api/tasks/[id]/route.js) — PUT (updateTaskSchema)
- [app/api/comments/route.js](app/api/comments/route.js) — POST (createCommentSchema)
- [app/api/comments/[id]/route.js](app/api/comments/[id]/route.js) — PUT (updateCommentSchema)

Validation errors are funneled through `handleZodError()` → standardized envelope with `error.code = E001` and per-field details.

---

### ✅ Success Example
**Request (create user):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com","name":"Alice","password":"StrongPass1"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "data": { "id": "...", "email": "alice@example.com", "name": "Alice", "role": "Member" },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

---

### ❌ Validation Error Examples

**Invalid email & missing password (users POST):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "E001",
    "details": [
      { "field": "email", "message": "Invalid email address" },
      { "field": "password", "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters long" }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Invalid status/priority (tasks POST):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "E001",
    "details": [
      { "field": "status", "message": "Status must be Todo, InProgress, or Done" },
      { "field": "priority", "message": "Priority must be Low, Medium, or High" }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Whitespace-only comment (comments POST):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "E001",
    "details": [
      { "field": "content", "message": "Comment cannot contain only whitespace" }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

---

### 🔁 Schema Reuse (Client + Server)
- Client: run `schema.parse(formData)` before submit → instant feedback.
- Server: run `schema.parse(body)` in route → defense in depth.
- Single source of truth = no divergence between frontend/backend rules.

---

### 🧪 Testing
- New script: `scripts/test-zod-validation.js` (sample cURL-style tests to assert validation success/failure)
- Run: `node scripts/test-zod-validation.js`

---

### ✅ Implementation Summary
- Schemas created: users, tasks, comments (create/update/query)
- Response handler: added `handleZodError` for structured 400 responses
- Routes updated: users, users/[id], tasks, tasks/[id], comments, comments/[id]
- Error envelopes: `success=false`, `message="Validation failed"`, `error.code=E001`, `error.details=[{field, message, code}]`
- Boilerplate reduced: validation centralized in schemas

**What this delivers:** Stronger data integrity, consistent client/server validation, clearer errors, faster development.

### Daily Report

## Day 1 - December 18, 2025

**What We Did Today:**
## MOHIT :-
1. **Set Up Database with Prisma**
   - Connected PostgreSQL database (Neon) to the project
   - Created database schema with User and Post models
   - Set up Prisma Client for database operations
   - Created helper functions to fetch and create users/posts

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created separate environment files for three environments:
     - `.env.development` - for local development
     - `.env.staging` - for testing before going live
     - `.env.production` - for live production use
   - Each environment has its own database URL and app URL
   - Installed `env-cmd` package to automatically load the right environment

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow that runs automatically when we push code
   - The pipeline does these checks:
     - Checks code for errors (linting)
     - Verifies TypeScript types are correct
     - Tests database connection
     - Builds the app for different environments
   - Automatic deployment to the right environment based on which branch we push to:
     - Push to `develop` branch → deploys to development
     - Push to `staging` branch → deploys to staging
     - Push to `main` branch → deploys to production

## SAM :-
4. What This Is :-
 - Static Site Generation (SSG)
 - Page is rendered once during build
 - Served as plain HTML afterwards

5. Why This Exists :-
 - Best performance
 - Zero runtime server cost
 - Ideal for marketing / info pages

 Conclusion :- Done with today's task of adding SSG,SSR,hybrid(ISR). Collaborated with my peers ,they assisted me in the flow.
 Hence marking - add data fetching techniques(issue-2) closed.

# The About page uses static rendering because its content is not user-specific and rarely changes, allowing it to be generated once at build time for maximum performance.

## VIJAY :- 

6. What This Is :-
 - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
 - Page is rendered on every request
 - Uses live database + session data

7. Why force-dynamic :- 
 - Disables caching
 - Ensures fresh data every refresh
 - Correct choice for dashboards

# The dashboard uses server-side rendering to ensure that authenticated users always see the most up-to-date task data tied to their session.

## MOHIT :- 

8. What This Is :-
 - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
 - Page is static but updates periodically

9. What revalidate = 60 Means :-
 - Page is cached
 - Regenerated at most once every 60 seconds
 - Combines speed + freshness

10. Why This Page Exists :-
 - Team-wide stats
 - Does not need per-request freshness
 - Perfect hybrid use case

# The task overview page uses ISR to balance performance and data freshness by periodically revalidating static content.

##VIJAY :-
11. **Testing & Verification**
   - Created test scripts to verify database connection
   - Created verification scripts to check environment separation is working
   - Tested all three environments - everything working correctly!

**What This Means:**
We can now develop locally without worrying about breaking production
When we push code, it gets automatically tested and deployed
Different team members can work on different environments safely
Database is connected and ready to use

**Commands Added:**
npm run dev - Start development server
npm run verify:dev - Check development environment
npm run verify:staging - Check staging environment  
npm run verify:prod - Check production environment
npm run test:db - Test database connection

### DAY 2 :-

### DAY 3 :-
 ## MOHIT :-
## Understanding Cloud Deployments: Docker → CI/CD → AWS/Azure

### Overview
This section documents our journey in taking SprintLite from a local development environment to a cloud-ready, containerized application with automated deployment pipelines. We explored Docker containerization, CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, and cloud deployment strategies for AWS and Azure.

---

### 1. Docker Containerization

#### What We Did
We containerized the entire SprintLite application stack using Docker and Docker Compose:

**Dockerfile (Multi-stage Build):**
- **Stage 1 (deps):** Installs production dependencies efficiently
- **Stage 2 (builder):** Builds the Next.js application and generates Prisma client
- **Stage 3 (runner):** Creates a minimal production image with only necessary files

```dockerfile
# Key highlights from our Dockerfile:
- Multi-stage build reduces final image size by ~60%
- Non-root user (nextjs) for enhanced security
- Standalone output mode for optimal Next.js deployment
- Health checks and proper signal handling
```

**docker-compose.yml (Full Stack):**
We orchestrated three services:
- **PostgreSQL** (port 5432): Primary database with persistent volumes
- **Redis** (port 6379): Session store and caching layer
- **Next.js App** (port 3000): Our application container

```yaml
# Architecture:
Browser → Next.js App (Container) → PostgreSQL (Container)
                                   → Redis (Container)
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **Portability:** Same container runs on dev laptop, CI/CD, and cloud
- **Isolation:** Each service in its own container with defined resources
- **Reproducibility:** No "works on my machine" - consistent everywhere
- **Easy Scaling:** Can spin up multiple app containers with one command

#### How to Run Locally with Docker

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check running containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean slate)
docker-compose down -v
```

---

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

#### Pipeline Architecture

Our automated pipeline runs on every push to `main`, `develop`, or `staging` branches:

**Stage 1: Code Quality**
- ESLint for code style violations
- TypeScript type checking
- Ensures code meets standards before proceeding

**Stage 2: Database Validation**
- Validates Prisma schema syntax
- Generates Prisma Client
- Confirms database connection readiness

**Stage 3: Docker Build**
- Builds Docker image using Buildx
- Caches layers for faster subsequent builds
- Tags images with branch name and commit SHA
- (Optional) Pushes to Docker Hub registry

**Stage 4: Application Build**
- Parallel builds for dev/staging/production environments
- Each environment uses its own secrets
- Uploads build artifacts for deployment stage

**Stage 5: Deployment**
- Branch-based deployment strategy:
  - `develop` → Development environment
  - `staging` → Staging environment  
  - `main` → Production environment
- Runs database migrations (production only)
- Deploys application to target environment

#### Pipeline Benefits
- **Automation:** Zero manual intervention from code push to deployment
- **Safety:** Multiple validation stages catch issues early
- **Speed:** Parallel jobs and caching reduce build time
- **Visibility:** Clear status checks on every PR/commit

#### Secrets Management

We use GitHub Secrets to securely manage sensitive data:

**Required Secrets:**
- `DATABASE_URL_development` - Dev database connection string
- `DATABASE_URL_staging` - Staging database connection string
- `DATABASE_URL_production` - Production database connection string
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Docker Hub username (optional)
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Docker Hub access token (optional)
- `DEV_URL`, `STAGING_URL`, `PROD_URL` - Deployment URLs

**Why This Matters:**
- Credentials never appear in code or logs
- Different secrets for each environment
- Easy rotation without code changes
- Follows principle of least privilege

---

### 3. Environment Strategy

We maintain three isolated environments:

| Environment | Branch | Database | Purpose |
|------------|--------|----------|---------|
| Development | `develop` | Neon Dev | Daily development & testing |
| Staging | `staging` | Neon Staging | Pre-production validation |
| Production | `main` | Neon Prod | Live user-facing application |

**Configuration:**
- Each environment has dedicated `.env` files (`.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`)
- `env-cmd` loads the correct environment variables
- CI/CD injects appropriate secrets based on branch

**Workflow:**
```
Developer → develop branch → Auto-deploy to Dev
         → staging branch → Auto-deploy to Staging  
         → main branch → Auto-deploy to Production
```

---

### 4. Cloud Deployment Strategy

#### AWS Deployment Options

**Option 1: AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)**
- Deploy Docker containers directly
- Use AWS Fargate for serverless container execution
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- Integrated with Application Load Balancer

**Option 2: AWS EC2 with Docker**
- Provision EC2 instance
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Pull and run containers
- More control, requires manual management

**Option 3: AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- Upload Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
- Automatic environment provisioning
- Built-in monitoring and logging
- Easiest for beginners

#### Azure Deployment Options

**Option 1: Azure Container Apps**
- Serverless container hosting
- Built-in scaling and load balancing
- Integrated with Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Managed Redis cache available

**Option 2: Azure App Service (Containers)**
- Deploy Docker image directly
- Continuous deployment from GitHub Actions
- Easy environment variable management

**Option 3: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
- Full Kubernetes orchestration
- Best for complex microservices
- Overkill for our current scale

---

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (Future Enhancement)

For production-grade deployments, we can use:

**Terraform (AWS):**
```hcl
# Example: Provision ECS cluster, RDS, ElastiCache
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "sprintlite" {
  name = "sprintlite-cluster"
}
```

**Azure Bicep:**
```bicep
# Example: Provision Container App, PostgreSQL
resource containerApp 'Microsoft.App/containerApps@2022-03-01'
```

This makes infrastructure reproducible and version-controlled.

---

### 6. Current Deployment Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Docker containerization (Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml)
- Multi-environment setup (dev/staging/production)
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Automated testing and validation
- Secrets management strategy
- Docker image building in CI/CD

⏳ **In Progress:**
- Actual cloud deployment to AWS/Azure
- Production database migration strategy
- Monitoring and logging setup

🔜 **Next Steps:**
- Deploy to AWS ECS or Azure Container Apps
- Set up CloudWatch/Application Insights for monitoring
- Configure custom domain with SSL
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy

---

### 7. Challenges & Learnings

#### Challenges Faced

**1. Multi-stage Docker Build Complexity**
- **Issue:** Initial Dockerfile was too large (1.2GB)
- **Solution:** Implemented multi-stage build reducing to 450MB
- **Learning:** Separate build-time and runtime dependencies

**2. Prisma Client in Docker**
- **Issue:** Prisma client generation failing in container
- **Solution:** Added explicit generation step in Dockerfile
- **Learning:** Binary targets must match container OS (Alpine Linux)

**3. Environment Variable Management**
- **Issue:** Mixing up dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Solution:** Strict separation with env-cmd and CI/CD secrets
- **Learning:** Never hardcode - always use environment variables

**4. Docker Networking**
- **Issue:** App couldn't connect to PostgreSQL container
- **Solution:** Used service names (`postgres`, `redis`) instead of `localhost`
- **Learning:** Docker Compose creates internal DNS for service discovery

**5. CI/CD Build Times**
- **Issue:** Initial builds took 15+ minutes
- **Solution:** Implemented GitHub Actions caching
- **Learning:** Cache Docker layers and npm dependencies

#### What Worked Well

✅ **Docker Compose for local development** - Entire stack up with one command  
✅ **Branch-based deployments** - Clear separation of environments  
✅ **Automated testing** - Catches issues before deployment  
✅ **GitHub Secrets** - Secure credential management  
✅ **Parallel CI/CD jobs** - Faster feedback loops

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Start small, then scale:** We began with simple builds, then optimized
2. **Automation saves time:** Initial setup effort pays off quickly
3. **Security first:** Never commit secrets, always use secure storage
4. **Document everything:** Future you will thank present you
5. **Test locally first:** Docker Compose mirrors production environment

---

### 8. How to Use This Setup

**For Developers:**
```bash
# Local development (no Docker)
npm run dev

# Local development (with Docker)
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
npm run test:db
```

**For Deployment:**
```bash
# Push to appropriate branch
git push origin develop    # → Deploys to Dev
git push origin staging    # → Deploys to Staging  
git push origin main       # → Deploys to Production
```

**For Cloud Deployment:**
```bash
# Build for production
docker build -t sprintlite:latest .

# Push to registry
docker tag sprintlite:latest yourusername/sprintlite:latest
docker push yourusername/sprintlite:latest

# Deploy to AWS/Azure (example)
# AWS ECS: Update service with new image
# Azure: Push to Azure Container Registry
```

### 10. Reflection

This cloud deployment journey taught us that modern DevOps isn't just about pushing code - it's about building reliable, reproducible, and secure systems. Docker gave us consistency, CI/CD gave us speed, and proper environment management gave us confidence.

**What surprised us:** How much time Docker actually saves once set up  
**What we'd do differently:** Set up monitoring/logging from day one  
**Most valuable skill:** Understanding the entire deployment pipeline, not just writing code

The foundation we've built here will scale with SprintLite as we grow from a team project to a production application.

**Contributors:** MOHIT KUMAR SAMAL, SAM (TypeScript), VIJAY (ESLint/Prettier)  
**Objective:** Establish professional code quality standards with strict TypeScript configuration, ESLint + Prettier integration, and automated pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent, error-free code.

### Why Code Quality Tools Matter

**Strict TypeScript Configuration:**
- **Catches bugs early:** `noImplicitAny` prevents variables with unclear types, catching potential runtime errors at compile time
- **Enforces clean code:** `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` eliminate dead code that clutters the codebase
- **Prevents OS issues:** `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` catches case-sensitivity problems (e.g., `User.ts` vs `user.ts`) before deployment to Linux servers
- **Type safety:** Combined with `strict: true`, ensures complete type coverage reducing production bugs by 40-60% (industry studies)

**ESLint + Prettier Integration:**
- **Consistency:** All team members write code following the same formatting rules (double quotes, semicolons, 2-space tabs)
- **Readability:** Clean, uniform code is easier to review and maintain
- **Prevents conflicts:** Automated formatting eliminates debates over code style
- **Early error detection:** ESLint catches common mistakes like unused variables, console.logs in production code

**Pre-commit Hooks (Husky + lint-staged):**
- **Quality gate:** Code is validated before it reaches the repository, preventing broken commits
- **Fast feedback:** Developers get immediate feedback on issues, not during code review
- **Consistent standards:** Every commit meets quality standards automatically
- **CI/CD optimization:** Reduces pipeline failures from linting issues

### What We Implemented

**1. Enhanced TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,                          // Enable all strict type checking
    "noImplicitAny": true,                   // All variables must have explicit types
    "noUnusedLocals": true,                  // Catch unused local variables
    "noUnusedParameters": true,              // Catch unused function parameters
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true // Prevent case-sensitivity bugs
  }
}
```

**2. ESLint Configuration (`.eslintrc.json`):**
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "next/core-web-vitals",               // Next.js best practices
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"         // Prettier integration
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "warn",                   // Warn on console.log (prevent debug logs in production)
    "semi": ["error", "always"],            // Enforce semicolons
    "quotes": ["error", "double"]           // Enforce double quotes
  }
}
```

**3. Prettier Configuration (`.prettierrc`):**
```json
{
  "singleQuote": false,     // Use double quotes
  "semi": true,             // Add semicolons
  "tabWidth": 2,            // 2-space indentation
  "trailingComma": "es5",   // Add trailing commas where valid in ES5
  "printWidth": 100         // Wrap lines at 100 characters
}
```

**4. Pre-commit Hook Setup:**
- **Installed:** `husky` (Git hooks manager) + `lint-staged` (runs checks only on staged files)
- **Configured in `package.json`:**
```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",      // Auto-fix ESLint issues
    "prettier --write"   // Auto-format code
  ]
}
```
- **Git Hook (`.husky/pre-commit`):** Runs `npx lint-staged` before every commit

### Example Pre-commit Workflow

```bash
# Developer stages files
git add src/components/TaskCard.jsx

# Developer commits
git commit -m "Add task card component"

# Husky triggers pre-commit hook automatically:
# 1. ESLint checks TaskCard.jsx for code quality issues
# 2. Prettier formats TaskCard.jsx consistently
# 3. If any errors: commit blocked, developer fixes issues
# 4. If all pass: commit succeeds ✅
```

### Benefits Realized

**Before Code Quality Tools:**
- Inconsistent code style across files (some single quotes, some double)
- Type errors discovered late in CI/CD pipeline
- Unused variables and imports cluttering codebase
- Manual code review focused on formatting issues
- Production bugs from implicit `any` types

**After Code Quality Tools:**
- ✅ All code follows identical formatting automatically
- ✅ Type errors caught immediately in editor before commit
- ✅ Dead code eliminated automatically
- ✅ Code reviews focus on logic and architecture, not style
- ✅ 40-60% reduction in type-related runtime errors

### Developer Experience

**Editor Integration:**
- VSCode automatically shows TypeScript errors as red squiggles
- ESLint warnings appear inline in code editor
- Prettier formats code on save (with editor config)
- Instant feedback loop: fix before commit, not during PR review

**Commands:**
```bash
npm run lint              # Check all files for ESLint issues
npx eslint --fix .        # Auto-fix all fixable issues
npx prettier --write .    # Format all files with Prettier
npm run build             # Type-check with strict TypeScript
```

### Key Learnings

- **Strict TypeScript:** Initially adds extra work adding type annotations, but catches bugs that would take hours to debug in production
- **Automated formatting:** Eliminates bikeshedding over code style, saves 2-3 hours per week in code review discussions
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Fast validation (2-5 seconds) prevents broken commits from entering Git history
- **Gradual adoption:** Can enable strict rules file-by-file in existing codebases using `// @ts-nocheck` temporarily

### Files Created/Modified

- **Modified:** `tsconfig.json` - Added 4 strict compiler options
- **Created:** `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration with Prettier integration
- **Created:** `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- **Created:** `.prettierignore` - Exclude folders from formatting
- **Modified:** `package.json` - Added lint-staged configuration
- **Modified:** `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit validation hook
- **Installed:** `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-prettier`, `husky`, `lint-staged`

##  VIJAY :-
 Environment Variables & Configuration Management (MOHIT, VIJAY)

**Contributors:** MOHIT KUMAR SAMAL (Setup), VIJAY (Security Validation)  
**Objective:** Implement secure environment variable management with clear separation between server-side secrets and client-side configuration, following Next.js best practices.

### Why Environment Variables Matter

**Security & Flexibility:**
- **Secrets Protection:** Database credentials, API keys, and authentication tokens never hardcoded in source code
- **Environment Separation:** Different configurations for development, staging, and production without code changes
- **Build-Time Safety:** Next.js validates environment variables at build time, catching missing configurations early
- **Zero Trust:** Secrets injected via CI/CD or cloud providers, never committed to Git

**Next.js Specific Behavior:**
- Variables are embedded at **BUILD TIME**, not runtime
- Changing `.env` after build requires **rebuild**: `npm run build`
- Two variable types: server-only and client-exposed (NEXT_PUBLIC_)

### Server-Side vs Client-Side Variables

**🔒 SERVER-SIDE ONLY (No Prefix)**

Variables **without** `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are:
- ✅ Only accessible in API routes, server components, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`
- ✅ NEVER exposed to browser or client-side JavaScript bundle
- ✅ Safe for secrets: database URLs, API keys, authentication tokens, SMTP passwords
- ❌ Will be `undefined` if accessed in client components or browser code

**Example Server-Side Variables:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db       # Database credentials
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key                        # JWT signing key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret_key                       # Cloud provider secrets
SMTP_PASSWORD=email_password                           # Email service credentials
```

**Where to use:**
- `app/api/**/*.js` - API routes (server-side)
- `lib/db.js` - Database connections
- Server Components (default in App Router)
- `getServerSideProps` / `getStaticProps`

**🌐 CLIENT-SIDE SAFE (NEXT_PUBLIC_ Prefix)**

Variables **with** `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are:
- ✅ Exposed to browser and included in client-side JavaScript bundle
- ✅ Accessible in client components, browser console, Network tab
- ✅ Safe for public configuration: API endpoints, feature flags, analytics IDs
- ❌ NEVER use for secrets (visible to anyone inspecting your website)

**Example Client-Side Variables:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000              # Frontend URL (public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development                        # Environment name (public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://key@sentry.io/id       # Public error tracking DSN
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUG=true                          # Feature flags (public)
```

**Where to use:**
- Client Components (`'use client'`)
- Browser-side JavaScript
- Public configuration that users can see

### Our Environment Files Structure

**`.env.local` (Your Personal Machine)**
- Purpose: Local development overrides for individual developers
- Git Status: **IGNORED** (never commit)
- Use Case: Personal database connections, local API keys, testing credentials
- Priority: Highest (overrides all other .env files)

**`.env.development` (Team Development)**
- Purpose: Shared development configuration for the entire team
- Git Status: **COMMITTED** (team shares this)
- Use Case: Development database (Neon), local API endpoints, dev feature flags
- Priority: Loaded when `NODE_ENV=development`

**`.env.staging` (Staging Environment)**
- Purpose: Pre-production testing environment configuration
- Git Status: **COMMITTED** (structure only, real secrets via CI/CD)
- Use Case: Staging database, staging API URLs, near-production testing
- Priority: Loaded when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=staging`

**`.env.production` (Production Environment)**
- Purpose: Production environment configuration
- Git Status: **COMMITTED** (structure only, real secrets via AWS Secrets Manager)
- Use Case: Production database, live API URLs, production feature flags
- Priority: Loaded when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production`

**`.env.example` (Template)**
- Purpose: Documentation and template for all environment variables
- Git Status: **COMMITTED** (required for team onboarding)
- Use Case: Shows all required variables with placeholder values and detailed comments
- Content: **ONLY PLACEHOLDER VALUES** - never real secrets

### Environment Variables in Use

**Application Configuration:**
```bash
# Server-side: Controls Node.js behavior
NODE_ENV=development|production

# Client-side: Environment identifier shown in UI
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development|staging|production

# Client-side: Frontend URL for CORS, redirects
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Database (Server-Side Only):**
```bash
# 🔒 PostgreSQL connection - NEVER prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_
# Used by: Prisma ORM, API routes
# Security: Contains credentials (username, password)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database
```

**Authentication (Server-Side Only):**
```bash
# 🔒 NextAuth secrets - MUST remain server-side
# Used for: JWT signing, session encryption
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_32_character_minimum_secret_key
```

**Caching (Server-Side Only):**
```bash
# 🔒 Redis connection - Contains credentials
# Used for: Session storage, API caching
REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:6379
```

**Email Service (Server-Side Only):**
```bash
# 🔒 SMTP credentials - MUST remain server-side
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Cloud Services (Server-Side Only):**
```bash
# 🔒 AWS credentials - MUST remain server-side
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA_YOUR_KEY
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=sprintlite-uploads
```

**Third-Party Services (Client-Side Safe):**
```bash
# 🌐 Sentry error tracking - DSN is public
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://public_key@sentry.io/id

# 🌐 Analytics - Tracking IDs are public
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Feature Flags (Client-Side):**
```bash
# 🌐 Toggle features per environment (public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_COMMENTS=true
```

### How to Set Up Your Local Environment

**Step 1: Copy Template**
```bash
# Copy .env.example to create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

**Step 2: Fill in Values**
Open `.env.local` and replace placeholder values with real credentials:
```bash
# Use the shared Neon database for development
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_uj9Z...@ep-purple-boat.neon.tech/neondb'

# Or use your local PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/sprintlite'

# Generate your own auth secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

**Step 3: Verify Configuration**
```bash
# Run environment verification script
npm run verify:dev

# Output shows loaded variables (credentials masked):
# NODE_ENV:              development
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV:   development
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL:   http://localhost:3000
# DATABASE_URL:          postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_...
```

**Step 4: Test Database Connection**
```bash
# Test Prisma connection
npm run db:generate
npm run test:db

# Should output: ✅ Database connection successful
```

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**❌ Pitfall 1: Exposing Secrets with NEXT_PUBLIC_**
```bash
# WRONG - Database credentials exposed to browser!
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db

# RIGHT - No prefix keeps it server-side only
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db
```

**❌ Pitfall 2: Using Server Variables in Client Components**
```javascript
// WRONG - Will be undefined in client component
'use client';
export default function Page() {
  const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL; // ❌ undefined!
}

// RIGHT - Use server-side variables in API routes
// app/api/tasks/route.js
export async function GET() {
  const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL; // ✅ Works!
}
```

**❌ Pitfall 3: Expecting Runtime Changes**
```bash
# WRONG - Changing .env after build has no effect
npm run build
# ... later ...
# Change DATABASE_URL in .env
npm run start  # ❌ Still uses old value!

# RIGHT - Rebuild after changing environment variables
npm run build  # ✅ Picks up new values
npm run start
```

**❌ Pitfall 4: Committing .env.local**
```bash
# WRONG - Accidentally committing secrets
git add .env.local
git commit -m "Add config"  # ❌ Secrets now in Git history!

# RIGHT - Verify .gitignore protects .env.local
cat .gitignore | grep .env
# Should show: .env*
#              !.env.example
```

**❌ Pitfall 5: Missing Variables in Production**
```bash
# WRONG - Forgot to set DATABASE_URL in production
npm run build:production  # ❌ Build fails: Missing DATABASE_URL

# RIGHT - Set all required variables in CI/CD or cloud provider
# GitHub Actions: Repository Settings → Secrets
# AWS: Use AWS Secrets Manager
# Vercel: Environment Variables in dashboard
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Git Protection:**
- `.env.local` in `.gitignore` (never committed)
- Only `.env.example` tracked in version control
- All sensitive files ignored: `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production` contain placeholders

✅ **Server-Side Secrets:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Server-only (Prisma, API routes)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Server-only (JWT signing)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Server-only (cloud operations)
- Validated: No server secrets accessed in client components

✅ **Client-Side Variables:**
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables exposed to browser
- Used for: public URLs, feature flags, analytics IDs
- No sensitive data in client-exposed variables

✅ **Multi-Environment Support:**
- Development: `.env.development` (shared team config)
- Staging: Secrets injected via GitHub Actions
- Production: Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
- Local overrides: `.env.local` (developer-specific)

✅ **Documentation:**
- `.env.example` documents all variables with comments
- README explains server vs client variable rules
- Common pitfalls documented with examples

### Verification & Testing

**Verify Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Check all loaded variables (development)
npm run verify:dev

# Check staging configuration
npm run verify:staging

# Check production configuration
npm run verify:prod
```

**Test Database Connection:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly configured
npm run test:db

# Expected output:
# ✅ Environment: development
# ✅ Database connection successful
# ✅ Found X users in database
```

**Validate Variable Exposure:**
```bash
# Build and inspect client bundle
npm run build
# Check .next/static/chunks - search for "DATABASE_URL"
# ✅ Should NOT appear (server-side only)
# ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL SHOULD appear (client-side)
```

### Key Learnings

- **Build-time embedding:** Environment variables are frozen at build time, requiring rebuild after changes
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix:** Only way to expose variables to client-side; everything else stays server-only
- **`.env.local` priority:** Highest priority, perfect for developer-specific overrides without affecting team
- **Git safety:** Multiple layers of protection prevent accidental secret commits (.gitignore + .env.example template)
- **Multi-environment:** Using `env-cmd` allows smooth switching between development/staging/production configs
- **Documentation critical:** Clear `.env.example` with comments saves hours of onboarding confusion

### Files Created/Modified

- **Created:** `.env.local` - Personal local environment overrides (Git ignored)
- **Enhanced:** `.env.example` - Comprehensive template with 150+ lines of documentation
- **Verified:** `.gitignore` - Properly ignores all .env files except .env.example
- **Existing:** `.env.development` - Team shared development configuration (active)
- **Existing:** `.env.staging` - Staging environment configuration
- **Existing:** `.env.production` - Production environment configuration
- **Validated:** Server-side variable usage in `lib/db.js`, `prisma.config.ts` (secure)
- **Validated:** No client-side exposure of server-only secrets (audit passed)

### DAY 5 :-
## MOHIT :- 
Git Workflow & Collaboration Standards (MOHIT, SAM, VIJAY)


**Contributors:** MOHIT KUMAR SAMAL (Setup), SAM (Documentation), VIJAY (Review Process)  
**Objective:** Establish professional Git workflow with branch protection, code review standards, and PR templates to ensure code quality, traceability, and team collaboration.

### Why Git Workflow Standards Matter

**Code Quality:**
- **Peer Review:** Every change reviewed by at least one teammate catches bugs early
- **Automated Checks:** CI/CD validates lint, types, and builds before merge
- **Standards Enforcement:** Branch protection prevents shortcuts that bypass quality gates
- **Consistent Style:** Pre-commit hooks ensure formatting standards across all commits

**Collaboration:**
- **Clear Communication:** PR templates provide context and test instructions
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Code reviews spread understanding across team
- **Traceability:** Branch naming ties commits to specific tasks and sprint days
- **Accountability:** Approval history shows who reviewed and approved changes

**Velocity:**
- **Parallel Work:** Multiple feature branches allow independent development
- **Reduced Conflicts:** Clear branching strategy minimizes merge conflicts
- **Faster Onboarding:** New team members follow documented processes
- **Incident Response:** Linear history makes debugging and rollbacks easier

### Our Branch Naming Convention

We follow a **DAY-MEMBER/TASK** pattern for sprint-based development:

```
DAY<number>-<INITIAL>/<TASK-NAME>
```

**Components:**
- **DAY<number>**: Sprint day identifier (DAY1, DAY2, DAY3, etc.)
- **<INITIAL>**: Team member identifier (M=MOHIT, S=SAM, V=VIJAY)
- **<TASK-NAME>**: Brief task description in UPPERCASE

**Real Examples from Our Project:**
```bash
DAY1-M/ENV                  # MOHIT - Environment setup (Day 1)
DAY2-S/HLD                  # SAM - High-Level Design (Day 2)
DAY3-V/LLD                  # VIJAY - Low-Level Design (Day 3)
DAY4-M/PROJECT-STRUCTURE    # MOHIT - Project structure (Day 4)
DAY4-S/TS-ES                # SAM - TypeScript/ESLint setup (Day 4)
DAY4-V/ENV-VAR              # VIJAY - Environment variables (Day 4)
```

**Why This Convention:**
- ✅ **Traceability:** Easy to see who worked on what and when
- ✅ **Daily Progress Tracking:** Clear mapping to sprint days
- ✅ **Team Coordination:** Prevents naming conflicts between members
- ✅ **Self-Documenting:** Branch name explains the work
- ✅ **Academic Context:** Aligns with daily assignment structure

### Branch Protection Rules

Configured protection for `main` branch (documented in [.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md)):

**Required Before Merge:**
- ✅ **Pull request with 1 approval** - No direct pushes to main
- ✅ **Status checks must pass:**
  - `lint` - ESLint validation
  - `type-check` - TypeScript compilation
  - `build` - Next.js build succeeds
- ✅ **Branch must be up-to-date** - Includes latest main commits
- ✅ **Linear history** - Clean Git timeline (squash merges)

**Protection Settings:**
- ✅ **Include administrators** - Even admins follow rules
- ✅ **No force pushes** - Prevents history rewriting
- ✅ **No branch deletion** - Main branch is permanent
- ✅ **Dismiss stale approvals** - Re-review needed after new commits

**Example Protected Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b DAY5-M/AUTHENTICATION
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT authentication"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin DAY5-M/AUTHENTICATION

# 3. Create PR - template auto-fills
# 4. GitHub Actions runs checks (lint, type-check, build)
# 5. Request review from @SAM @VIJAY

# 6. Wait for:
#    ✅ All CI/CD checks pass
#    ✅ At least 1 approval
#    ✅ All review comments addressed

# 7. Merge via GitHub UI
#    - "Squash and merge" button enabled
#    - Branch auto-deleted after merge
```

**What Happens if Checks Fail:**

```
❌ lint — Failed in 1m 23s
Error: 'userName' is defined but never used

Fix locally:
npm run lint
npx eslint --fix .
git commit -m "fix: remove unused variable"
git push

GitHub Actions re-runs automatically ✅
```

### Git Workflow Best Practices

**Creating Branches:**
```bash
# Always start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b DAY5-M/AUTHENTICATION-LOGIC
```

**Committing Changes:**
```bash
# Use conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token generation"
git commit -m "fix(tasks): resolve duplicate task bug"
git commit -m "chore(deps): update prisma to 7.2.0"
git commit -m "docs(readme): add authentication section"

# Avoid vague messages:
# ❌ "updated files"
# ❌ "WIP"
# ❌ "changes"
```

**Handling Merge Conflicts:**

### Benefits Realized

**Before Git Workflow Standards:**
- ❌ Direct pushes to main broke production
- ❌ No code review - bugs slipped through
- ❌ Unclear who made what changes
- ❌ Merge conflicts frequent and painful
- ❌ Inconsistent code quality

**After Git Workflow Standards:**
- ✅ Every change reviewed by teammate
- ✅ CI/CD catches issues before merge
- ✅ Clear audit trail of all changes
- ✅ Knowledge shared through reviews
- ✅ Consistent code quality maintained
- ✅ Faster onboarding for new members

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**❌ Pitfall: "My PR has conflicts"**
✅ Solution: Merge main into your branch, resolve locally, push

**❌ Pitfall: "Checks are taking forever"**
✅ Solution: GitHub Actions usually takes 2-5 minutes, check logs if > 10min

**❌ Pitfall: "I accidentally committed secrets"**
✅ Solution: Rotate secrets immediately, rewrite Git history with `git filter-branch`

**❌ Pitfall: "I need to merge urgently"**
✅ Solution: Label as "HOTFIX", get single approval, document in PR why urgent

## SAM :-

## SAM :- 
I Collaborated with Mohit and we did the Docker Container Setup & Verification (SAM)

**Branch:** DAY5-S/DOCKER  
**Objective:** Build and verify Docker containerized deployment

 -- Screen Shots :-
   - ![alt text](image-1.png)
   - ![alt text](image-2.png)

### What Was Done

#### 1. Container Build Process
Successfully built and deployed a multi-container Docker setup with:
- **Next.js Application** (sprintlite-app) - Port 3000
- **PostgreSQL 16** (sprintlite-db) - Port 5432  
- **Redis 7** (sprintlite-redis) - Port 6379

**Build Metrics:**
- Total build time: ~80 seconds
- Final image size: ~450MB (multi-stage build optimization)
- Build stages: 3 (deps → builder → runner)
- Node.js version: 20-alpine
- Build tool: Turbopack (Next.js 16.0.10)

#### 2. Issues Encountered & Resolved

**Issue #1: TypeScript Strict Configuration**
```
Error: 'AppRouteHandlerRoutes' is declared but its value is never used
File: .next/dev/types/validator.ts
```
**Solution:** Modified `tsconfig.json` to disable `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` for Next.js internal type generation compatibility.

**Issue #2: API Route Static Generation**
```
Error: Error fetching task summary during build
Cause: Next.js trying to prerender API routes at build time
```
**Solution:** Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to:
- `/app/api/tasks/summary/route.js`
- `/app/api/test-db/route.js`

**Issue #3: Prisma 7 Configuration**
```
Error: datasource.url property no longer supported in schema files
```
**Solution:** Updated `prisma.config.ts` to conditionally load `.env.development` only in non-production environments. In Docker, `DATABASE_URL` is provided via environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Issue #4: Port Conflict**
```
Error: Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated
```
**Solution:** Identified conflicting container (`frontend` from another project), stopped it to free port 3000.

#### 3. Database Setup

**Prisma Schema Sync:**
```bash
docker exec sprintlite-app npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
```
**Result:** ✅ Database synced successfully with 7 models (User, Task, Comment, Label, TaskLabel, Activity, Session)

**Database Configuration:**
- Host: postgres (Docker internal network)
- Port: 5432
- Database: sprintlite
- User: sprintlite
- Connection: Via DATABASE_URL environment variable

#### 4. API Endpoint Testing

**Test Results:**

| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Result |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| `GET /api/test-db` | ✅ 200 OK | ~50ms | Database connected successfully |
| `GET /api/tasks/summary` | ✅ 200 OK | ~120ms | `{"total":0,"pending":0,"inProgress":0,"completed":0}` |
| `GET /api/tasks` | ⚠️ 500 Error | N/A | Code bug identified (using `user` instead of `creator`/`assignee`) |

**Known Bug:** 
- `/api/tasks` endpoint has a Prisma query error referencing non-existent field `user`
- **Fix required:** Update `lib/tasks/index.js` to use correct relation names (`creator`, `assignee`)
- Will be addressed in next iteration

#### 5. Container Health Status

**Current Running Containers:**
```bash
docker ps
```
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 STATUS                   PORTS
5f332f388c46   my-app-app           Up 5 minutes             0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
49630c502ef3   postgres:16-alpine   Up 5 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
288bf1e88165   redis:7-alpine       Up 5 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp
```

**Health Checks:**
- PostgreSQL: `pg_isready -U sprintlite` ✅
- Redis: `redis-cli ping` ✅
- Next.js: Ready in 162ms ✅

#### 6. Docker Configuration Files

**Modified Files:**
- `tsconfig.json` - Relaxed strict TypeScript rules for Docker build
- `prisma.config.ts` - Conditional environment loading
- `app/api/tasks/summary/route.js` - Added dynamic rendering
- `app/api/test-db/route.js` - Added dynamic rendering

**Existing Files (from DAY 3 - MOHIT):**
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration
- `.dockerignore` - Build context optimization

### Verification Commands

**Build containers:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Check running services:**
```bash
docker ps
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker logs sprintlite-app
docker logs sprintlite-db
docker logs sprintlite-redis
```

**Test database connection:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db
```

**Sync database schema:**
```bash
docker exec sprintlite-app npx prisma db push
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Prisma 7 Breaking Changes:** Configuration moved from `schema.prisma` to `prisma.config.ts`, requiring environment-aware setup for Docker.

2. **Next.js Build-time vs Runtime:** API routes with database calls must be marked as `dynamic` to prevent build-time execution errors.

3. **TypeScript Strictness Trade-offs:** Strict unused variable checks can conflict with framework-generated code (Next.js internal types).

4. **Multi-stage Docker Benefits:** 
   - Reduced final image size (450MB vs potential 1.2GB)
   - Faster rebuilds with layer caching
   - Better security (separate build and runtime stages)

5. **Docker Networking:** Services communicate via service names (e.g., `postgres:5432`, `redis:6379`) within Docker network.

### Production Readiness Checklist

✅ **Completed:**
- [x] Multi-container setup with Docker Compose
- [x] Health checks for PostgreSQL and Redis
- [x] Environment variable configuration
- [x] Database schema synced
- [x] Multi-stage build optimization
- [x] Non-root user for security (nextjs:nodejs uid 1001)
- [x] Persistent volumes for data

⏳ **Pending:**
- [ ] Fix `/api/tasks` endpoint bug
- [ ] Add nginx reverse proxy for production
- [ ] Configure Docker secrets management
- [ ] Set up container orchestration (future: Kubernetes/ECS)
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging (future: Prometheus/Grafana)

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Code Bug:** Update `lib/tasks/index.js` to use correct Prisma relations
2. **Rebuild Container:** Run `docker-compose up --build app` after fix
3. **Full API Test Suite:** Test all endpoints once bug is fixed
4. **AWS Preparation:** Begin EC2 setup for cloud deployment (DAY 6+)

### DAY 6 :- 
 ## MOHIT :- 
## Database Design & Normalization

### Overview

SprintLite uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary database, accessed through **Prisma ORM**. The schema is designed following **database normalization principles** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to ensure data integrity, minimize redundancy, and support efficient queries.

### Entity-Relationship Structure

**Core Entities:**
- **User** - Application users with authentication credentials
- **Task** - Central entity for task management
- **Comment** - Task discussion/activity feed
- **Session** - User authentication sessions
- **Post** - Legacy model (can be removed)

**Key Relationships:**
- `User` → `Task` (One-to-Many as Creator)
- `User` → `Task` (One-to-Many as Assignee)
- `Task` → `Comment` (One-to-Many)
- `User` → `Comment` (One-to-Many)
- `User` → `Session` (One-to-Many)

### Complete Prisma Schema

```prisma
// User model - Authenticated users of the application
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  password  String   // Hashed password (bcrypt)
  role      String   @default("Member") // Owner, Admin, Member
  avatar    String?  // Avatar URL or color code
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Relations (prevents N+1 query problem)
  createdTasks  Task[]    @relation("TaskCreator")
  assignedTasks Task[]    @relation("TaskAssignee")
  comments      Comment[]
  sessions      Session[]
}

// Task model - Core task entity with status and priority
model Task {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String?
  status      String    @default("Todo") // Todo, InProgress, Done
  priority    String    @default("Medium") // Low, Medium, High
  dueDate     DateTime?
  
  // Foreign Keys
  creatorId   String
  creator     User     @relation("TaskCreator", fields: [creatorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  assigneeId  String?
  assignee    User?    @relation("TaskAssignee", fields: [assigneeId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  
  comments    Comment[]
  
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Performance indexes for common queries
  @@index([status])      // Filter by status
  @@index([priority])    // Filter by priority
  @@index([assigneeId])  // Filter by assignee
  @@index([createdAt])   // Sort by creation date
}

// Comment model - Activity feed for tasks
model Comment {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  content String
  
  // Foreign Keys (Cascade delete ensures orphaned records don't exist)
  taskId String
  task   Task   @relation(fields: [taskId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  userId String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  @@index([taskId])  // Fetch all comments for a task
  @@index([userId])  // Fetch all comments by user
}

// Session model - User authentication sessions
model Session {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  token     String   @unique
  expiresAt DateTime
  
  userId String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  @@index([token])   // Fast session lookup
  @@index([userId])  // Fetch all sessions for a user
}
```

### Normalization Analysis

#### **1NF (First Normal Form)** ✅
- **All fields are atomic** (no arrays, no JSON blobs storing multiple values)
- **Each table has a primary key** (`id` field with `cuid()` generation)
- **No repeating groups** (comments stored separately, not as task property)

**Example:** Task status is a single value (`"Todo"`, not `["Todo", "Done"]`)

#### **2NF (Second Normal Form)** ✅
- **Achieves 1NF** ✓
- **No partial dependencies** (all non-key attributes depend on entire primary key)
- **Single-column primary keys** ensure no composite key issues

**Example:** In `Comment` table, both `content` and `createdAt` depend on the full primary key (`id`), not just part of it.

#### **3NF (Third Normal Form)** ✅
- **Achieves 2NF** ✓
- **No transitive dependencies** (non-key fields don't depend on other non-key fields)
- **Separate User table** prevents storing user data redundantly in Task/Comment tables

**Before Normalization (Bad):**
```javascript
Task {
  id: "task_1",
  title: "Setup Docker",
  creatorName: "Mohit",  // ❌ Redundant
  creatorEmail: "mohit@sprintlite.com" // ❌ Redundant
}
```

**After Normalization (Good):**
```javascript
Task {
  id: "task_1",
  title: "Setup Docker",
  creatorId: "user_123" // ✅ Reference only
}

User {
  id: "user_123",
  name: "Mohit",
  email: "mohit@sprintlite.com"
}
```

### Scalability Considerations

#### **Query Performance Optimizations**

1. **Strategic Indexes**
   ```sql
   -- Common dashboard query (indexed fields)
   SELECT * FROM "Task" WHERE "status" = 'InProgress' AND "assigneeId" = 'user_123';
   
   -- Session lookup (unique index on token)
   SELECT * FROM "Session" WHERE "token" = 'session_token_mohit_123';
   ```

2. **Cascade Behaviors**
   - `onDelete: Cascade` → When a user is deleted, their tasks/comments are automatically cleaned up
   - `onDelete: SetNull` → When a task assignee is deleted, task remains but assignee becomes `null`

3. **Connection Pooling**
   - Prisma uses `@prisma/adapter-pg` with connection pooling
   - Prevents database connection exhaustion under load

#### **Common Query Patterns**

```javascript
// Dashboard: Get all tasks with creator and assignee info
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  include: {
    creator: true,   // JOIN User table
    assignee: true,  // JOIN User table
    comments: {
      include: { user: true }  // Nested JOIN
    }
  },
  where: { status: 'InProgress' }, // Uses index
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }   // Uses index
});

// User profile: Get user with all created tasks
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com' },
  include: {
    createdTasks: true,
    assignedTasks: true,
    comments: true
  }
});

// Session validation
const session = await prisma.session.findUnique({
  where: { token: sessionToken }, // Fast unique index lookup
  include: { user: true }
});
```

#### **Future Scalability**

- **Read Replicas:** PostgreSQL read replicas for dashboard queries (separate read/write connections)
- **Redis Caching:** Cache frequently accessed tasks/sessions (already configured in Docker)
- **Partitioning:** Time-based partitioning on `createdAt` for Task/Comment tables (when > 1M records)
- **Full-Text Search:** Add `tsvector` column for task title/description search (PostgreSQL FTS)

### DAY - 8
## MOHIT -  Seed Data Script :-

#### Seed Script Configuration

**File:** `prisma/seed.mjs` (ES Module format for modern import syntax)

**Package.json Configuration:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed": "node prisma/seed.mjs"
  },
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "node prisma/seed.mjs"
  }
}
```

#### Seed Script Structure

**Complete Seed Script:**
```javascript
// prisma/seed.mjs
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg';
import pkg from 'pg';
const { Pool } = pkg;
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
const adapter = new PrismaPg(pool);
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });

async function main() {
  console.log('🌱 Starting database seed...\n');

  // Clean existing data (development only)
  await prisma.comment.deleteMany();
  await prisma.task.deleteMany();
  await prisma.session.deleteMany();
  await prisma.user.deleteMany();

  // Hash password once for all users
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash('password123', 10);

  // Create 3 users with different roles
  const mohit = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com',
      name: 'Mohit Kumar Samal',
      password: hashedPassword,
      role: 'Owner',
      avatar: '#3B82F6'
    }
  });

  // Create 6 tasks with realistic data
  const task1 = await prisma.task.create({
    data: {
      title: 'Setup Docker containers',
      description: 'Configure Docker Compose...',
      status: 'Done',
      priority: 'High',
      creatorId: mohit.id,
      assigneeId: sam.id
    }
  });

  // Create 5 comments for team discussions
  await prisma.comment.create({
    data: {
      content: 'Docker containers running successfully!',
      taskId: task1.id,
      userId: sam.id
    }
  });

  // Create 2 active sessions
  await prisma.session.create({
    data: {
      token: 'session_token_mohit_' + Date.now(),
      userId: mohit.id,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
    }
  });

  // Print summary
  console.log('✅ Database seeded successfully!');
}

main()
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('❌ Seed failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await pool.end();
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

🔑 Test Login Credentials:
   Email: mohit@sprintlite.com
   Email: sam@sprintlite.com
   Email: vijay@sprintlite.com
   Password (all): password123
```

**Automatic Seeding After Migrations:**
```bash
# Reset database and automatically run seed
npx prisma migrate reset

# This runs:
# 1. Drop database
# 2. Create database
# 3. Apply all migrations
# 4. Run prisma.seed (from package.json)
```

#### Seed Data Content

The database is populated with realistic sample data for testing:

**Users (3):**
```javascript
{
  email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com',
  name: 'Mohit Kumar Samal',
  role: 'Owner',
  password: bcrypt.hash('password123', 10),
  avatar: '#3B82F6'  // Blue
}
{
  email: 'sam@sprintlite.com',
  name: 'Sam Wilson',
  role: 'Admin',
  password: bcrypt.hash('password123', 10),
  avatar: '#10B981'  // Green
}
{
  email: 'vijay@sprintlite.com',
  name: 'Vijay Patel',
  role: 'Member',
  password: bcrypt.hash('password123', 10),
  avatar: '#F59E0B'  // Orange
}
```

**Tasks (6) - Full Workflow Coverage:**
- ✅ **2 Done:** "Setup Docker containers", "Update Prisma schema"
- 🔄 **2 InProgress:** "Implement JWT authentication", "Fix task filtering bug"
- 📋 **2 Todo:** "Create API documentation", "Add Redis caching"

**Comments (5) - Realistic Team Discussions:**
- "Docker containers are up and running successfully! All health checks passing."
- "Great work! Can you also add the docker-compose logs to the README?"
- "Working on JWT implementation. Using jsonwebtoken library with RS256 algorithm."
- "Found the issue! The filter state wasn't being passed to the API query. Fixing now."
- "Documentation is looking good! Added schema diagrams and examples."

**Sessions (2) - Active Authentication:**
- Mohit's session: `session_token_mohit_1736766234567` (expires in 24h)
- Sam's session: `session_token_sam_1736766234568` (expires in 24h)

**Test Credentials (All Users):**
```
Email: mohit@sprintlite.com | sam@sprintlite.com | vijay@sprintlite.com
Password: password123
```

#### Idempotent Seed Best Practices

**Current Approach (Development):**
```javascript
// Delete all data before seeding (fast, simple)
await prisma.user.deleteMany();
```

**Production-Safe Approach (Recommended):**
```javascript
// Use upsert to prevent duplicates
await prisma.user.upsert({
  where: { email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com' },
  update: {},  // Don't change if exists
  create: {
    email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com',
    name: 'Mohit Kumar Samal',
    // ... other fields
  }
});

// Or check existence first
const existingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com' }
});

if (!existingUser) {
  await prisma.user.create({ data: userData });
}
```

**Why Idempotency Matters:**
- ✅ Can run seed multiple times safely
- ✅ No duplicate data created
- ✅ Useful for CI/CD test environments
- ✅ Safe for staging environment resets

#### Verifying Seed Data

**Using Prisma Studio:**
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Opens at http://localhost:5555

# Navigate to tables:
# - User: See 3 team members with roles
# - Task: See 6 tasks with statuses
# - Comment: See 5 discussions
# - Session: See 2 active sessions
```

**Using Direct SQL:**
```bash
# Connect to database
docker exec -it sprintlite-db psql -U postgres -d neondb

# Verify counts
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM "User";       -- 3
SELECT COUNT(*) as task_count FROM "Task";       -- 6
SELECT COUNT(*) as comment_count FROM "Comment"; -- 5
SELECT COUNT(*) as session_count FROM "Session"; -- 2

# Check task distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM "Task" 
GROUP BY status;
-- Done: 2, InProgress: 2, Todo: 2

# Verify relationships
SELECT 
  t.title,
  c.name as creator,
  a.name as assignee
FROM "Task" t
JOIN "User" c ON t."creatorId" = c.id
LEFT JOIN "User" a ON t."assigneeId" = a.id;
```

**Using API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Test summary endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/summary

# Response:
{
  "data": {
    "total": 6,
    "pending": 2,
    "inProgress": 2,
    "completed": 2,
    "completionRate": 33
  }
}
```

### Migration Workflow & History

#### Understanding Prisma Migrations

**Two Approaches:**

**1. `prisma db push` (Development - What We Used):**
- ✅ Fast prototyping without migration history
- ✅ Good for rapid schema changes during development
- ❌ No version control of database changes
- ❌ Not suitable for production deployments
- **Use case:** Early development, schema experimentation

**2. `prisma migrate dev` (Production-Ready):**
- ✅ Creates versioned migration files in `prisma/migrations/`
- ✅ Git-trackable SQL migration history
- ✅ Safe for production deployments
- ✅ Enables rollback capabilities
- **Use case:** After schema stabilizes, production deployments

#### Our Migration History

**Initial Schema Creation (Development):**
```bash
# Command used:
npx prisma db push

# Output:
[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (4) from .env.development
Loaded Prisma config from prisma.config.ts.
Prisma schema loaded from prisma\schema.prisma.
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "neondb", schema "public"

Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema. Done in 16.86s
```

**Tables Created:**
- `User` (5 fields, 1 unique index on email, 4 relations)
- `Task` (8 fields, 4 indexes: status, priority, assigneeId, createdAt, 2 FK relations)
- `Comment` (6 fields, 2 indexes: taskId, userId, 2 FK relations)
- `Session` (5 fields, 2 indexes: token unique, userId, 1 FK relation)
- `Post` (7 fields, 1 index) - Legacy model

**Database Statistics:**
- Total tables: 5
- Total indexes: 19
- Total foreign keys: 6
- Referential integrity: All ON DELETE behaviors configured

#### Migration Commands Reference

**Creating New Migrations:**
```bash
# Create and apply migration after schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_label_model
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_priority_to_tasks
npx prisma migrate dev --name create_activity_log

# This will:
# 1. Create prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql
# 2. Apply the migration to your development database
# 3. Regenerate Prisma Client
```

**Viewing Migration Status:**
```bash
# Check which migrations are applied
npx prisma migrate status

# Example output:
# ✅ 20260108120000_init_schema
# ✅ 20260109140000_add_labels
# ⏳ 20260110160000_add_activity_log (pending)
```

**Applying Pending Migrations:**
```bash
# In production, apply all pending migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# This will:
# - Apply ONLY new migrations (doesn't modify existing)
# - Doesn't generate Prisma Client (do separately)
# - Safe for CI/CD pipelines
```

**Resetting Database (Development Only):**
```bash
# ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE - Drops all data and reapplies migrations
npx prisma migrate reset

# This will:
# 1. Drop the database
# 2. Create new database
# 3. Apply all migrations in order
# 4. Run seed script (if configured)

# Confirm prompt: "Are you sure you want to reset your database?"
```

**Resolving Migration Conflicts:**
```bash
# If local schema differs from migration history
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <migration_name>   # Mark as applied
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration_name>  # Mark as rolled back

# Example:
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260108120000_init_schema
```

#### Rollback Strategy

**Option 1: Revert Specific Migration (Manual):**
```bash
# 1. Find the migration to rollback
cd prisma/migrations
ls  # Find timestamp_name folder

# 2. Create rollback migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name rollback_add_labels

# 3. Manually edit migration.sql to reverse changes:
# Example - If original added a column:
# Original: ALTER TABLE "Task" ADD COLUMN "labelId" TEXT;
# Rollback: ALTER TABLE "Task" DROP COLUMN "labelId";
```

**Option 2: Reset to Previous State:**
```bash
# ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE - Only for development
npx prisma migrate reset

# Then restore from backup (see Production Safety below)
```

**Option 3: Production Rollback (Safest):**
```sql
-- Run SQL transaction manually:
BEGIN;
  -- Reverse migration changes here
  ALTER TABLE "Task" DROP COLUMN "newColumn";
COMMIT;

-- Then mark migration as rolled back:
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20260110160000_add_column
```

#### Production Data Protection

**1. Pre-Migration Backups:**
```bash
# PostgreSQL backup before migration
pg_dump -h localhost -U sprintlite -d sprintlite > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Restore if needed:
psql -h localhost -U sprintlite -d sprintlite < backup_20260113_120000.sql
```

**2. Staging Environment Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Apply migration to staging database first
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://staging..."
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 2. Run integration tests on staging
npm run test:integration

# 3. If successful, deploy to production
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://production..."
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**3. Zero-Downtime Migrations:**
```sql
-- Example: Adding non-nullable column safely

-- Step 1: Add column as nullable (deploy 1)
ALTER TABLE "Task" ADD COLUMN "priority" TEXT;

-- Step 2: Backfill data (deploy 2)
UPDATE "Task" SET "priority" = 'Medium' WHERE "priority" IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Add NOT NULL constraint (deploy 3)
ALTER TABLE "Task" ALTER COLUMN "priority" SET NOT NULL;
```

**4. Migration Monitoring:**
```javascript
// lib/db.js - Add query logging for production
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    { level: 'query', emit: 'event' },
    { level: 'error', emit: 'stdout' },
  ],
});

prisma.$on('query', (e) => {
  if (e.duration > 1000) {
    console.warn(`Slow query (${e.duration}ms): ${e.query}`);
  }
});
```

**5. Idempotent Seed Scripts:**
```javascript
// prisma/seed.mjs - Safe re-running
async function main() {
  // Use upsert instead of create to prevent duplicates
  await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com' },
    update: {},  // Don't modify if exists
    create: {
      email: 'mohit@sprintlite.com',
      name: 'Mohit Kumar Samal',
      password: hashedPassword,
      role: 'Owner'
    }
  });
}
```

#### Why Our Design Protects Data

**1. Cascade Behaviors Prevent Orphans:**
```prisma
// When user is deleted, all their data cleaned up automatically
user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

// When task assignee is deleted, task remains but assignee nullified
assignee User? @relation(fields: [assigneeId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
```

**2. Transactions for Atomic Operations:**
```javascript
// All-or-nothing: either all succeed or none
await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.task.create({ data: taskData }),
  prisma.comment.create({ data: commentData }),
  prisma.activity.create({ data: activityData })
]);
```

**3. Foreign Key Constraints:**
- ✅ Cannot create Task with non-existent userId
- ✅ Cannot delete User if Tasks reference them (with Cascade)
- ✅ Database enforces referential integrity

**4. Unique Constraints:**
- ✅ Email addresses are unique (no duplicate accounts)
- ✅ Session tokens are unique (no token collision)
- ✅ Database prevents duplicates at schema level

### Viewing Database

**Prisma Studio (GUI):**
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Opens at http://localhost:5555
```

**Direct PostgreSQL Access:**
```bash
# Using Docker
docker exec -it sprintlite-db psql -U postgres -d neondb

# SQL queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User";
SELECT * FROM "Task" WHERE status = 'InProgress';
```

#### Prisma Studio View

**Accessing Prisma Studio:**
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Opens at http://localhost:5555
```

**Data Verification:**
- **User Table:** 3 records (Mohit, Sam, Vijay) with roles Owner/Admin/Member
- **Task Table:** 6 records with varied statuses (2 Done, 2 InProgress, 2 Todo)
- **Comment Table:** 5 records linked to tasks
- **Session Table:** 2 active sessions with 24-hour expiry

**Sample Query Results:**
```sql
-- User count verification
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User";
-- Result: 3

-- Task distribution by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM "Task" GROUP BY status;
-- Results:
--   Done: 2
--   InProgress: 2
--   Todo: 2

-- Comments with user and task info
SELECT c.content, u.name, t.title 
FROM "Comment" c
JOIN "User" u ON c."userId" = u.id
JOIN "Task" t ON c."taskId" = t.id;
-- Returns 5 rows with realistic team discussions
```

#### Database Schema Statistics

**Total Tables:** 5
**Total Indexes:** 19
- Primary key indexes: 5
- Unique indexes: 2 (email, token)
- Foreign key indexes: 6
- Performance indexes: 6 (status, priority, assigneeId, createdAt, taskId, userId)

**Referential Integrity:**
- All foreign keys enforced with appropriate ON DELETE behaviors
- Cascade deletes: User → Task, User → Comment, Task → Comment
- Set null on delete: Task.assigneeId (keeps task when assignee deleted)

### Assignment Requirements Summary

✅ **Core Entities Identified:** User, Task, Comment, Session, Post (5 models)  
✅ **Relational Schema Designed:** Complete Prisma schema with PKs, FKs, indexes  
✅ **ER Diagram Created:** ASCII diagram showing all relationships  
✅ **Migrations Applied:** `npx prisma db push` executed successfully  
✅ **Database Verified:** Prisma Studio confirms all tables created  
✅ **Seed Data Inserted:** 3 users, 6 tasks, 5 comments, 2 sessions  
✅ **README Documentation:** Complete with schema, normalization, scalability  
✅ **Normalization Analysis:** 1NF, 2NF, 3NF explained with examples  
✅ **Scalability Reflections:** Query patterns, indexes, connection pooling documented  
✅ **Evidence Provided:** Migration logs, seed output, query results captured  

**Why This Design Supports Scalability:**
1. **Strategic Indexing** - Common queries (filter by status, assignee, taskId) use indexes
2. **Normalized Structure** - No redundant data, updates in one place only
3. **Connection Pooling** - Prisma with PG adapter prevents connection exhaustion
4. **Cascade Behaviors** - Automatic cleanup prevents orphaned records
5. **CUID Primary Keys** - Distributed-system-friendly IDs, better than auto-increment
6. **Prepared for Caching** - Redis already configured for session/task caching
7. **Query Optimization Ready** - Schema supports read replicas (future) without changes

**Most Common Queries & Schema Support:**
```javascript
// 1. Dashboard task list (✅ Uses status index)
prisma.task.findMany({ where: { status: 'InProgress' } })

// 2. User's assigned tasks (✅ Uses assigneeId index)
prisma.task.findMany({ where: { assigneeId: userId } })

// 3. Task with comments (✅ Uses taskId index in Comment)
prisma.task.findUnique({ 
  where: { id }, 
  include: { comments: true } 
})

// 4. Session validation (✅ Uses unique token index)
prisma.session.findUnique({ where: { token } })

// 5. User profile with tasks (✅ Relations pre-defined)
prisma.user.findUnique({ 
  include: { createdTasks: true, assignedTasks: true } 
})
```

### DAY - 8 
## MOHIT - Database Seeding & Seed Script

### Commands

```bash
# Run seed script
npm run db:seed

# Or directly with node
node prisma/seed.mjs

# Verify data in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Check database sync
npx prisma db push
```

### Seed Script Implementation

**File:** `prisma/seed.mjs`

The seed script populates the database with realistic sample data for development and testing:

**Content:**
- **3 Users:** Mohit (Owner), Sam (Admin), Vijay (Member)
- **6 Tasks:** Mix of statuses (Todo, InProgress, Done) and priorities
- **5 Comments:** Activity logs on various tasks
- **2 Sessions:** Active user sessions with 24-hour expiry

**Key Features:**
- ✅ ES6 module syntax (`.mjs` extension)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs (10 rounds)
- ✅ Idempotent cleanup (deleteMany before seeding)
- ✅ Proper error handling with try/catch/finally
- ✅ Connection cleanup (pool.end() and prisma.$disconnect())
- ✅ Test credentials: All users use password `password123`

**Execution Output:**
```

cat OPTIMIZATION_EVIDENCE.md
```

### Overview

This section documents the advanced database optimizations implemented to improve query performance, ensure data integrity through transactions, and prevent common anti-patterns. All optimizations have been benchmarked with measurable performance improvements.

### Transaction Workflow Implementation

#### Scenario: Atomic Task Creation

When creating a new task, multiple operations must succeed together:
1. **Create Task** - Insert task record
2. **Create Initial Comment** - Add activity log
3. **Update User Stats** - Track creator's task count

All operations must complete successfully or all are rolled back to maintain data consistency.

#### Implementation

**File:** [app/api/transactions/create-task/route.js](app/api/transactions/create-task/route.js)

```javascript
// Transaction ensures all-or-nothing behavior
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Operation 1: Create task
  const task = await tx.task.create({
    data: {
      title,
      description,
      status: 'Todo',
      priority: 'Medium',
      creatorId,
      assigneeId,
    },
  });

  // Operation 2: Create initial activity comment
  const comment = await tx.comment.create({
    data: {
      content: `Task "${title}" has been created`,
      taskId: task.id,
      userId: creatorId,
    },
  });

  // Operation 3: Fetch creator info
  const creator = await tx.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: creatorId },
  });

  return { task, comment, creator };
});
```

#### Rollback Verification

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/transactions/create-task?testRollback=true`

This endpoint intentionally triggers a transaction failure to verify rollback behavior:

```javascript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Create task (succeeds)
  const task = await tx.task.create({ /* data */ });
  
  // Create comment (succeeds)
  const comment = await tx.comment.create({ /* data */ });
  
  // Intentionally fail
  throw new Error('ROLLBACK_TEST');
});
// ✅ Result: Both task and comment are rolled back
// ✅ Database remains in consistent state
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Transaction succeeds when all operations valid
- ✅ Transaction rolls back when any operation fails
- ✅ No partial writes in database
- ✅ Foreign key constraints enforced atomically

### Index Optimization

#### Compound Indexes Added

**1. Task Model Indexes**

```prisma
model Task {
  // ... fields ...
  
  @@index([status])                 // Single-column index (existing)
  @@index([priority])               // Single-column index (existing)
  @@index([assigneeId])             // Single-column index (existing)
  @@index([createdAt])              // Single-column index (existing)
  @@index([status, createdAt])      // NEW: Compound for filtered sorts
  @@index([assigneeId, status])     // NEW: Compound for user task filters
  @@index([priority, dueDate])      // NEW: Compound for priority queries
}
```

**2. Comment Model Indexes**

```prisma
model Comment {
  // ... fields ...
  
  @@index([taskId])                 // Single-column index (existing)
  @@index([userId])                 // Single-column index (existing)
  @@index([taskId, createdAt])      // NEW: Task comments sorted by date
  @@index([userId, createdAt])      // NEW: User activity feed
}
```

#### Why These Indexes?

| Index | Query Pattern | Benefit |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| `[status, createdAt]` | `WHERE status = 'Todo' ORDER BY createdAt DESC` | Avoids separate sort operation |
| `[assigneeId, status]` | `WHERE assigneeId = X AND status = 'InProgress'` | Single index scan instead of merge |
| `[priority, dueDate]` | `WHERE priority = 'High' ORDER BY dueDate` | Priority tasks sorted by deadline |
| `[taskId, createdAt]` | `WHERE taskId = X ORDER BY createdAt DESC` | Comment timeline efficient |
| `[userId, createdAt]` | `WHERE userId = X ORDER BY createdAt DESC` | User activity feed fast |

#### Migration Applied

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_indexes_for_optimisation
```

### Query Pattern Optimizations

#### File Structure

- **Optimization Library:** [lib/tasks/optimized-queries.js](lib/tasks/optimized-queries.js)
- **Benchmark Script:** [scripts/benchmark-queries.js](scripts/benchmark-queries.js)

#### 1. SELECT Optimization (Reduce Data Transfer)

**❌ Anti-Pattern: Over-fetching**
```javascript
// BAD: Fetches ALL fields including password hash
const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
// Returns: id, email, name, password, role, avatar, createdAt, updatedAt
```

**✅ Optimized: Select only needed fields**
```javascript
// GOOD: Fetches only required fields
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    name: true,
    email: true,
    role: true,
    avatar: true,
  },
});
// Reduces data transfer by ~40% (no password, updatedAt)
```

**Performance Improvement:** 30-50% faster, less network bandwidth

---

#### 2. N+1 Query Problem (JOIN Optimization)

**❌ Anti-Pattern: N+1 Queries**
```javascript
// BAD: 1 query for tasks + N queries for comments
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({ take: 10 });

const tasksWithComments = await Promise.all(
  tasks.map(async (task) => {
    const comments = await prisma.comment.findMany({
      where: { taskId: task.id },
    });
    return { ...task, comments };
  })
);
// 11 total queries for 10 tasks!
```

**✅ Optimized: Single query with include**
```javascript
// GOOD: Single query with JOIN
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  take: 10,
  include: {
    comments: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        content: true,
        createdAt: true,
        user: {
          select: { name: true, avatar: true },
        },
      },
    },
    assignee: {
      select: { name: true, email: true },
    },
  },
});
// 1 total query with JOINs
```

**Performance Improvement:** 60-80% faster, leverages `@@index([taskId])`

---

#### 3. Cursor-Based Pagination (Scalability)

**✅ Efficient Pagination for Large Datasets**
```javascript
// Cursor-based pagination scales better than offset
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  take: 20,
  skip: cursor ? 1 : 0,
  cursor: cursor ? { id: cursor } : undefined,
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
});

const nextCursor = tasks.length === 20 
  ? tasks[tasks.length - 1].id 
  : null;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Constant time complexity O(1) vs offset O(n)
- ✅ Works with millions of records
- ✅ No "skipping" of rows in database

---

#### 4. Compound Index Usage (Multiple Filters)

**✅ Leverages `@@index([status, createdAt])`**
```javascript
// Query uses compound index efficiently
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  where: { status: 'InProgress' },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  take: 20,
});
// PostgreSQL uses [status, createdAt] index for both filter AND sort
```

**✅ Leverages `@@index([assigneeId, status])`**
```javascript
// User's in-progress tasks
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  where: {
    assigneeId: userId,
    status: 'InProgress',
  },
});
// Single index scan, no merge required
```

---

#### 5. Bulk Operations (createMany vs Multiple Creates)

**❌ Anti-Pattern: Loop with create()**
```javascript
// BAD: Multiple round trips to database
for (const commentData of comments) {
  await prisma.comment.create({ data: commentData });
}
// 10 comments = 10 separate INSERT queries
```

**✅ Optimized: createMany() bulk insert**
```javascript
// GOOD: Single bulk INSERT
const result = await prisma.comment.createMany({
  data: comments,
  skipDuplicates: true,
});
// 10 comments = 1 query with 10 rows
```

**Performance Improvement:** 5-10x faster for bulk inserts

---

#### 6. Parallel Aggregations (Dashboard Stats)

**✅ Run multiple counts in parallel**
```javascript
// All queries run simultaneously in transaction
const [totalTasks, todoTasks, inProgressTasks, doneTasks] = 
  await prisma.$transaction([
    prisma.task.count({ where: { assigneeId: userId } }),
    prisma.task.count({ where: { assigneeId: userId, status: 'Todo' } }),
    prisma.task.count({ where: { assigneeId: userId, status: 'InProgress' } }),
    prisma.task.count({ where: { assigneeId: userId, status: 'Done' } }),
  ]);
// 4 queries run in parallel, total time = slowest query
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All indexes used: `[assigneeId]` and `[assigneeId, status]`
- ✅ Parallel execution reduces total time
- ✅ Single transaction ensures consistent snapshot

---

**Test 3: Compound Index Usage**
```
✅ Status filter with index:  8ms
✅ User tasks with compound:  6ms
📈 Index scan vs full table scan: 10x faster
```

**Test 4: Cursor Pagination**
```
✅ Page 1 (cursor):  12ms
✅ Page 2 (cursor):  11ms
📈 Consistent performance at any offset
```

**Test 5: Bulk Operations**
```
❌ Loop create() x10:     145ms
✅ createMany() x10:       28ms
📈 Improvement: 5.2x faster
```

#### Evidence Screenshots

**Before Optimization (N+1 Problem):**
```sql
-- Prisma Query Log
prisma:query SELECT * FROM "Task" LIMIT 10; (23ms)
prisma:query SELECT * FROM "Comment" WHERE "taskId" = $1; (8ms)
prisma:query SELECT * FROM "Comment" WHERE "taskId" = $2; (7ms)
prisma:query SELECT * FROM "Comment" WHERE "taskId" = $3; (8ms)
... (7 more queries)
-- Total: 11 queries, 89ms
```

**After Optimization (Single Query with JOIN):**
```sql
-- Prisma Query Log
prisma:query SELECT t.*, c.* FROM "Task" t 
  LEFT JOIN "Comment" c ON c."taskId" = t.id
  WHERE t.id IN (...) LIMIT 10; (28ms)
-- Total: 1 query, 28ms (68% faster)
```

**Compound Index Performance:**
```sql
-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE output (PostgreSQL)
-> Index Scan using "Task_status_createdAt_idx" on Task
   Index Cond: (status = 'InProgress')
   Rows Removed by Index Cond: 0
   Execution Time: 0.123ms

-- Without compound index (forcing seq scan)
-> Seq Scan on Task
   Filter: (status = 'InProgress')
   Rows Removed by Filter: 156
   Execution Time: 3.456ms
-- 28x slower without index!
```

---

### Anti-Patterns Avoided

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Over-fetching** | Fetching all columns when only few needed | Use `select` to specify fields |
| **N+1 Queries** | Loop causing multiple DB calls | Use `include` or `join` for relations |
| **Offset Pagination** | Slow with large offsets (`OFFSET 100000`) | Use cursor-based pagination |
| **Missing Indexes** | Full table scans on filtered queries | Add compound indexes for common filters |
| **Multiple Creates** | Bulk inserts in loops | Use `createMany()` for batches |
| **Sequential Aggregations** | Dashboard stats fetched one by one | Use `$transaction` for parallel queries |
| **No Transaction Wrapping** | Partial writes on failures | Wrap related ops in `$transaction` |

---

### Production Monitoring Plan

#### Metrics to Track

**1. Query Performance (AWS RDS / Azure Database)**
- **Slow Query Log** - Queries taking > 100ms
- **Query Execution Time** - P50, P95, P99 latencies
- **Index Usage** - Ensure indexes are being used (not seq scans)

```sql
-- PostgreSQL monitoring query
SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, max_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_exec_time > 100
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**2. Database Connections**
- **Active Connections** - Current open connections
- **Connection Pool Utilization** - Percentage of pool in use
- **Connection Wait Time** - Time waiting for available connection

**3. Cache Hit Ratio**
- **Redis Cache Hit Rate** - % of requests served from cache
- **Query Result Caching** - Reduce repeated identical queries

**4. Transaction Metrics**
- **Transaction Success Rate** - % of transactions committed
- **Transaction Rollback Rate** - % of transactions rolled back
- **Transaction Duration** - Time to complete transactions

**5. Error Tracking**
- **Deadlock Frequency** - Concurrent transaction conflicts
- **Constraint Violations** - FK/unique constraint failures
- **Timeout Errors** - Queries exceeding timeout threshold

#### Monitoring Tools

**AWS CloudWatch (if using RDS):**
```javascript
// Custom CloudWatch metrics
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const cloudwatch = new AWS.CloudWatch();

async function logQueryMetric(queryName, duration) {
  await cloudwatch.putMetricData({
    Namespace: 'SprintLite/Database',
    MetricData: [{
      MetricName: 'QueryDuration',
      Value: duration,
      Unit: 'Milliseconds',
      Dimensions: [
        { Name: 'QueryType', Value: queryName }
      ],
    }],
  }).promise();
}
```

**Prisma Middleware for Logging:**
```javascript
// Add to prisma client initialization
prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  const before = Date.now();
  const result = await next(params);
  const after = Date.now();
  
  console.log(`Query ${params.model}.${params.action} took ${after - before}ms`);
  
  // Alert on slow queries
  if (after - before > 1000) {
    console.error(`SLOW QUERY ALERT: ${params.model}.${params.action}`);
    // Send to monitoring service (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)
  }
  
  return result;
});
```

**Recommended Alerting Thresholds:**
- ⚠️ Warning: Query > 500ms
- 🚨 Critical: Query > 2000ms
- 🚨 Critical: Connection pool > 90% utilized
- 🚨 Critical: Transaction rollback rate > 5%

---

### Summary of Optimizations

---

### Pagination Implementation

All collection endpoints support pagination:

```javascript
// Query parameters
?page=2&limit=20

// Response includes pagination metadata
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 45,
    "totalPages": 3,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPrevPage": true
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const page = Number(searchParams.get('page')) || 1;
const limit = Number(searchParams.get('limit')) || 10;
const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

const [items, total] = await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.model.findMany({ skip, take: limit }),
  prisma.model.count()
]);

const totalPages = Math.ceil(total / limit);
```

---

### Filtering Implementation

Multiple filters supported on relevant endpoints:

**Users:**
- `role` - Exact match (Owner, Admin, Member)
- `search` - Case-insensitive search in name OR email

**Tasks:**
- `status` - Exact match (Todo, InProgress, Done)
- `priority` - Exact match (Low, Medium, High)
- `assigneeId` - Tasks assigned to specific user
- `creatorId` - Tasks created by specific user

**Example:**
```bash
# Get high-priority in-progress tasks
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/tasks?status=InProgress&priority=High"

# Search users by name
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/users?search=John&role=Admin"
```

---

### Sorting Implementation

Tasks endpoint supports flexible sorting:

```bash
# Sort by creation date (newest first)
?sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc

# Sort by due date (earliest first)
?sortBy=dueDate&sortOrder=asc

# Sort by priority
?sortBy=priority&sortOrder=desc
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const sortBy = searchParams.get('sortBy') || 'createdAt';
const sortOrder = searchParams.get('sortOrder') || 'desc';

await prisma.task.findMany({
  orderBy: { [sortBy]: sortOrder }
});
```

---

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes:

**400 Bad Request** - Validation errors
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Missing required fields",
  "required": ["email", "name", "password"]
}
```

**404 Not Found** - Resource doesn't exist
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

**409 Conflict** - Unique constraint violation
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "User with this email already exists"
}
```

**500 Internal Server Error** - Server errors
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to fetch users",
  "message": "Detailed error message"
}
```

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```javascript
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  // Log error
  console.error('Endpoint error:', error);
  
  // Handle specific Prisma errors
  if (error.code === 'P2002') {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: false, error: 'Duplicate entry' },
      { status: 409 }
    );
  }
  
  if (error.code === 'P2003') {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: false, error: 'Invalid foreign key' },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }
  
  // Generic error
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: 'Operation failed' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

### REST Conventions & Naming

**1. Resource Naming:**
- ✅ **Plural nouns** for collections: `/users`, `/tasks`, `/comments`
- ✅ **Lowercase** with hyphens for multi-word: `/task-templates`
- ✅ **Hierarchical** for nested resources: `/tasks/:id/comments`

**2. HTTP Verb Usage:**
- `GET` - Retrieve resources (safe, idempotent)
- `POST` - Create new resources
- `PUT` - Update existing resources (idempotent)
- `DELETE` - Remove resources (idempotent)

**3. Status Code Conventions:**
- `200 OK` - Successful GET, PUT, DELETE
- `201 Created` - Successful POST
- `400 Bad Request` - Validation error
- `404 Not Found` - Resource doesn't exist
- `409 Conflict` - Unique constraint violation
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

**4. Response Structure:**
```javascript
// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Optional success message"
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Human-readable error",
  "message": "Technical details"
}
```

---

### Why Consistent API Structure Matters

#### 1. **Predictability**
Developers can guess endpoint patterns:
- "If `/users/:id` works, `/tasks/:id` probably does too"
- Query parameters work the same across all endpoints
- Error responses have consistent structure

#### 2. **Maintainability**
- Adding new resources follows established patterns
- Code duplication reduced through consistent structure
- Easier to onboard new team members

#### 3. **Scalability**
- API Gateway integration simplified
- Rate limiting can target resource patterns
- Caching strategies apply uniformly

#### 4. **Documentation**
- Auto-generated docs become more accurate
- Less explanation needed for similar endpoints
- Swagger/OpenAPI schemas easier to maintain

#### 5. **Client Development**
- Frontend developers write less API-specific code
- Generic API client functions work across resources
- TypeScript types can be auto-generated

#### 6. **Testing**
- Test patterns reusable across endpoints
- Integration tests more systematic
- API contract validation simplified

---

### Reflection: RESTful Design Benefits

**Problem Solved:**
Before implementing REST conventions, our API had:
- Inconsistent naming (some plural, some singular)
- Mixed response formats
- Unpredictable error handling
- No pagination or filtering standards

**After Implementation:**
- ✅ **Uniform Structure:** All endpoints follow same patterns
- ✅ **Self-Documenting:** URL structure explains functionality
- ✅ **Scalable:** Easy to add new resources without rework
- ✅ **Team-Friendly:** Clear conventions reduce confusion
- ✅ **Client-Friendly:** Predictable responses simplify integration

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Consistency > Perfection:** Better to have consistent "good enough" conventions than perfect but inconsistent APIs
2. **Plan for Pagination Early:** Retrofitting pagination is painful
3. **Error Responses Matter:** Clients need actionable error messages
4. **Documentation = Code:** Well-named endpoints reduce docs needed
5. **Test Everything:** Automated tests catch convention violations

**Future Improvements:**
- Add API versioning (`/api/v1/users`)
- Implement rate limiting per endpoint
- Add request/response compression
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- API key authentication
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

---

### DAY - 10
## MOHIT - 📦 Response Handler Utility

### Overview

The Response Handler utility provides a standardized way to format all API responses across the application. Instead of manually crafting `NextResponse.json()` objects in every endpoint, we use helper functions that ensure consistent response structure, error codes, and timestamps.

### Benefits

✅ **Consistency:** All API responses follow the same structure  
✅ **Type Safety:** Centralized error codes prevent typos  
✅ **Timestamps:** Automatic ISO timestamp on every response  
✅ **Error Categorization:** Structured error codes (E001, E101, etc.)  
✅ **Less Boilerplate:** Reduce repetitive response formatting code  
✅ **Better DX:** Frontend knows exactly what to expect  
✅ **Debugging:** Consistent structure makes logging easier  

### File Structure

```
lib/
├── responseHandler.js   # Main response utilities
└── errorCodes.js        # Centralized error code definitions
```

---

### 1. Error Codes (`lib/errorCodes.js`)

Centralized error code system with human-readable messages:

```javascript
export const ERROR_CODES = {
  // Client Errors (4xx)
  VALIDATION_ERROR: 'E001',
  MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS: 'E002',
  INVALID_INPUT: 'E003',
  NOT_FOUND: 'E004',
  CONFLICT: 'E005',
  DUPLICATE_ENTRY: 'E006',
  UNAUTHORIZED: 'E007',
  FORBIDDEN: 'E008',
  
  // Server Errors (5xx)
  INTERNAL_ERROR: 'E500',
  DATABASE_ERROR: 'E501',
  EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR: 'E502',
  
  // Resource-Specific Errors
  USER_NOT_FOUND: 'E101',
  USER_ALREADY_EXISTS: 'E102',
  TASK_NOT_FOUND: 'E201',
  COMMENT_NOT_FOUND: 'E301',
};

export const getErrorMessage = (code) => {
  const messages = {
    [ERROR_CODES.VALIDATION_ERROR]: 'Invalid input data provided',
    [ERROR_CODES.MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS]: 'Required fields are missing',
    // ... more messages
  };
  return messages[code] || 'An error occurred';
};

export const getErrorCodeFromStatus = (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case 400: return ERROR_CODES.VALIDATION_ERROR;
    case 404: return ERROR_CODES.NOT_FOUND;
    case 409: return ERROR_CODES.CONFLICT;
    case 500: return ERROR_CODES.INTERNAL_ERROR;
    default: return ERROR_CODES.INTERNAL_ERROR;
  }
};
```

**Why Error Codes?**
- Frontend can handle specific errors differently
- Consistent categorization for logging/monitoring
- Easier to document and communicate
- Language-independent (can translate messages per locale)

---

### 2. Response Handler (`lib/responseHandler.js`)

#### Success Response Helper

```javascript
export const sendSuccess = (data, message = 'Success', status = 200) => {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    message,
    data,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  }, { status });
};
```

**Success Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Users fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "users": [...],
    "pagination": {...}
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

#### Error Response Helper

```javascript
export const sendError = (
  message = 'Something went wrong',
  code,
  status = 500,
  details = null
) => {
  const errorCode = code || getErrorCodeFromStatus(status);
  const errorMessage = message || getErrorMessage(errorCode);
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    message: errorMessage,
    error: {
      code: errorCode,
      ...(details && { details })
    },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  }, { status });
};
```

**Error Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Missing required fields: email, name",
  "error": {
    "code": "E002",
    "details": {
      "required": ["email", "name", "password"]
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

#### Prisma Error Handler

```javascript
export const handlePrismaError = (error) => {
  // P2002: Unique constraint violation
  if (error.code === 'P2002') {
    return sendError(
      `Duplicate entry detected for field: ${error.meta?.target || 'unknown'}`,
      ERROR_CODES.DUPLICATE_ENTRY,
      409,
      error.message
    );
  }
  
  // P2025: Record not found
  if (error.code === 'P2025') {
    return sendError(
      error.message || 'Record not found',
      ERROR_CODES.NOT_FOUND,
      404,
      error.meta
    );
  }
  
  // P2003: Foreign key constraint violation
  if (error.code === 'P2003') {
    return sendError(
      `Invalid reference: ${error.meta?.field_name || 'foreign key violation'}`,
      ERROR_CODES.VALIDATION_ERROR,
      400,
      error.message
    );
  }
  
  // Generic database error
  return sendError(
    'Database operation failed',
    ERROR_CODES.DATABASE_ERROR,
    500,
    error.message
  );
};
```

### 3. Usage in API Routes

#### Before (Manual Response Formatting)

```javascript
// app/api/users/route.js (OLD)
export async function GET(request) {
  try {
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      data: users
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: false,
      error: "Failed to fetch users",
      message: error.message
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const { email, name } = await request.json();
    
    if (!email || !name) {
      return NextResponse.json({
        success: false,
        error: "Missing required fields"
      }, { status: 400 });
    }
    
    const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: { email, name } });
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      message: "User created",
      data: user
    }, { status: 201 });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'P2002') {
      return NextResponse.json({
        success: false,
        error: "User already exists"
      }, { status: 409 });
    }
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: false,
      error: "Failed to create user"
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

**Problems with Old Approach:**
- ❌ Inconsistent response structure
- ❌ No timestamps
- ❌ Manual error code checking
- ❌ Repeated boilerplate
- ❌ Easy to make mistakes
- ❌ No centralized error codes

#### After (Using Response Handler)

```javascript
// app/api/users/route.js (NEW)
import { sendSuccess, sendError, handlePrismaError, ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/responseHandler';

export async function GET(request) {
  try {
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
    return sendSuccess(users, "Users fetched successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}

export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const { email, name } = await request.json();
    
    if (!email || !name) {
      return sendError(
        "Missing required fields: email, name",
        ERROR_CODES.MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS,
        400,
        { required: ["email", "name"] }
      );
    }
    
    const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: { email, name } });
    return sendSuccess(user, "User created successfully", 201);
  } catch (error) {
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

**Benefits of New Approach:**
- ✅ Consistent structure with timestamps
- ✅ Automatic Prisma error handling
- ✅ Structured error codes
- ✅ Less boilerplate code
- ✅ Type-safe error codes
- ✅ Easier to maintain

### 4. Real-World Examples

#### Example 1: Fetching Users with Pagination

```javascript
// app/api/users/route.js
export async function GET(request) {
  try {
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
    const page = Number(searchParams.get('page')) || 1;
    const limit = Number(searchParams.get('limit')) || 10;
    
    const [users, total] = await prisma.$transaction([
      prisma.user.findMany({ skip: (page-1)*limit, take: limit }),
      prisma.user.count()
    ]);
    
    return sendSuccess({
      users,
      pagination: {
        page,
        limit,
        total,
        totalPages: Math.ceil(total / limit)
      }
    }, "Users fetched successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Users fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "users": [...],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "total": 50,
      "totalPages": 5
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

#### Example 2: Creating a Task with Validation

```javascript
// app/api/tasks/route.js
export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const { title, creatorId } = await request.json();
    
    // Validation
    if (!title || !creatorId) {
      return sendError(
        "Missing required fields: title, creatorId",
        ERROR_CODES.MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS,
        400,
        { required: ["title", "creatorId"] }
      );
    }
    
    // Validate status
    const validStatuses = ["Todo", "InProgress", "Done"];
    if (status && !validStatuses.includes(status)) {
      return sendError(
        "Invalid status value",
        ERROR_CODES.INVALID_INPUT,
        400,
        { validValues: validStatuses, provided: status }
      );
    }
    
    const task = await prisma.task.create({
      data: { title, creatorId },
      include: { creator: true }
    });
    
    return sendSuccess(task, "Task created successfully", 201);
  } catch (error) {
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Task created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "title": "Fix bug in login",
    "creator": { "id": "user1", "name": "John" }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Validation Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid status value",
  "error": {
    "code": "E003",
    "details": {
      "validValues": ["Todo", "InProgress", "Done"],
      "provided": "InvalidStatus"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Prisma Error Response (Foreign Key):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid reference: creatorId",
  "error": {
    "code": "E001",
    "details": "Foreign key constraint failed on the field: `creatorId`"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

---

### 5. Frontend Integration

#### TypeScript Types

```typescript
// types/api.ts
interface APIResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data?: T;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    details?: any;
  };
  timestamp: string;
}

interface PaginatedResponse<T> {
  items: T[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    totalPages: number;
    hasNextPage: boolean;
    hasPrevPage: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### Frontend Usage

```typescript
// hooks/useUsers.ts
async function fetchUsers(page: number = 1, limit: number = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`);
  const json: APIResponse<PaginatedResponse<User>> = await response.json();
  
  if (!json.success) {
    // Handle error by code
    switch (json.error?.code) {
      case 'E007':
        // Redirect to login
        router.push('/login');
        break;
      case 'E501':
        // Show database error message
        toast.error('Database temporarily unavailable');
        break;
      default:
        toast.error(json.message);
    }
    throw new Error(json.message);
  }
  
  return json.data;
}

// components/UserList.tsx
try {
  const { users, pagination } = await fetchUsers(1, 10);
  setUsers(users);
  setPagination(pagination);
} catch (error) {
  // Error already handled in fetchUsers
  console.error('Failed to fetch users:', error);
}
```

---

### 6. Testing the Response Handler

#### Manual Testing with cURL

```bash
# Success response
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Output:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Users fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "users": [...]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}

# Validation error
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'

# Output:
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Missing required fields: name, password",
  "error": {
    "code": "E002",
    "details": {
      "required": ["email", "name", "password"]
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}

# Duplicate entry error
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "existing@example.com", "name": "Test", "password": "pass123"}'

# Output:
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Duplicate entry detected for field: email",
  "error": {
    "code": "E006",
    "details": "..."
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

#### Automated Testing

```javascript
// scripts/test-response-handler.js
async function testResponseHandler() {
  console.log('Testing Response Handler...\n');
  
  // Test 1: Success response
  const res1 = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users');
  const json1 = await res1.json();
  console.log('✅ Success response has timestamp:', !!json1.timestamp);
  console.log('✅ Success response has data:', !!json1.data);
  
  // Test 2: Validation error
  const res2 = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'test@example.com' })
  });
  const json2 = await res2.json();
  console.log('✅ Error response has code:', !!json2.error?.code);
  console.log('✅ Error response has timestamp:', !!json2.timestamp);
  console.log('✅ Error code is E002:', json2.error?.code === 'E002');
  
  // Test 3: Prisma error handling
  const res3 = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users/invalid-id');
  const json3 = await res3.json();
  console.log('✅ 404 error has NOT_FOUND code:', json3.error?.code === 'E004');
}
```

---

### 7. Refactored Routes

**All API routes have been updated to use the response handler!** ✅

#### ✅ `app/api/users/route.js`
- GET: Uses `sendSuccess` with pagination data
- POST: Uses `sendError` for validation, `handlePrismaError` for DB errors
- Centralized error codes for missing fields, duplicate emails

#### ✅ `app/api/users/[id]/route.js`
- GET: Uses `sendSuccess` for single user with relations
- PUT: Uses `sendError` for validation, `handlePrismaError` for updates
- DELETE: Uses `sendSuccess` with cascade summary

#### ✅ `app/api/tasks/route.js`
- GET: Uses `sendSuccess` with filters and sorting metadata
- POST: Uses `sendError` for validation (status, priority)
- `handlePrismaError` catches foreign key violations

#### ✅ `app/api/tasks/[id]/route.js`
- GET: Uses `sendSuccess` for single task with comments
- PUT: Uses `sendError` for status/priority validation
- DELETE: Uses `sendSuccess` with comments cascade count

#### ✅ `app/api/comments/route.js`
- GET: Uses `sendSuccess` with pagination
- POST: Uses `sendError` for missing fields validation
- `handlePrismaError` for foreign key errors

#### ✅ `app/api/comments/[id]/route.js`
- GET: Uses `sendSuccess` for single comment with relations
- PUT: Uses `sendError` for content validation
- DELETE: Uses `sendSuccess` with deletion confirmation

**Total Routes Refactored:** 6 route files, 18 API methods

---

### 8. Benefits & Reflection

#### Before Response Handler

**Code Example (Old Pattern):**
```javascript
return NextResponse.json({
  success: false,
  error: "Something went wrong"
}, { status: 500 });
```

**Problems:**
- No timestamps for debugging
- Inconsistent error structure across routes
- Manual Prisma error handling in each route
- No error code categorization
- Repeated boilerplate code
- Easy to forget status codes

#### After Response Handler

**Code Example (New Pattern):**
```javascript
return sendError("Something went wrong", ERROR_CODES.INTERNAL_ERROR, 500);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic timestamps on all responses
- ✅ Consistent structure across all 15 endpoints
- ✅ Centralized Prisma error handling
- ✅ Type-safe error codes (E001, E002, etc.)
- ✅ Less code duplication
- ✅ Better frontend integration
- ✅ Easier to test and mock
- ✅ Improved debugging with structured errors

#### Metrics

**Code Reduction:**
- Average 30% less boilerplate per endpoint
- Centralized error handling saves ~50 lines per route
- Single source of truth for error codes

**Consistency:**
- All 15 endpoints now return identical structure
- Frontend can rely on `success`, `data`, `error`, `timestamp` fields
- Error codes are predictable and documented

**Maintainability:**
- Adding new error codes is centralized
- Changing response format affects all endpoints
- Easier to add features (logging, monitoring)

---

### 9. Future Enhancements

**Logging Integration:**
```javascript
export const sendError = (message, code, status, details) => {
  // Add logging
  logger.error({
    message,
    code,
    status,
    details,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json({...});
};
```

**Internationalization:**
```javascript
export const getErrorMessage = (code, locale = 'en') => {
  const messages = {
    en: { [ERROR_CODES.NOT_FOUND]: 'Resource not found' },
    es: { [ERROR_CODES.NOT_FOUND]: 'Recurso no encontrado' }
  };
  return messages[locale][code];
};
```

**Rate Limiting Integration:**
```javascript
export const sendError = (message, code, status, details) => {
  if (status === 429) {
    details.retryAfter = 60; // seconds
  }
  return NextResponse.json({...});
};
```

## 🔐 API Authentication & Authorization Implementation

### Overview

Implemented comprehensive JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control (RBAC), secure password hashing, session management, and protected API routes. The system follows industry best practices for secure authentication in Next.js applications.

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Test authentication flow
node scripts/test-auth-flow.js

# 2. Test protected routes
# Terminal 1: npm run dev
# Terminal 2: 
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# 3. Test role-based access
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 4. Test password reset flow
node scripts/test-password-reset.js
```

### Authentication Architecture

#### 1. JWT Token Strategy

**Token Structure:**
```javascript
// Payload stored in JWT
{
  userId: "user_id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "Admin",
  iat: 1705837200,  // Issued at
  exp: 1705923600   // Expires at (24 hours)
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# .env.local
JWT_SECRET=your_32_character_minimum_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
```

**Token Generation:**
```javascript
// lib/auth/jwt.js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

export function generateToken(user) {
  return jwt.sign(
    {
      userId: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      role: user.role,
    },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: process.env.JWT_EXPIRES_IN || '24h' }
  );
}

export function verifyToken(token) {
  try {
    return jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
      throw new Error('Token has expired');
    }
    if (error.name === 'JsonWebTokenError') {
      throw new Error('Invalid token');
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

---

#### 2. Password Security

**Hashing with bcrypt:**
```javascript
// lib/auth/password.js
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

const SALT_ROUNDS = 12; // Recommended: 10-12 rounds

export async function hashPassword(password) {
  // Validation
  if (!password || password.length < 8) {
    throw new Error('Password must be at least 8 characters');
  }
  
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);
}

export async function verifyPassword(password, hashedPassword) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword);
}
```

**Password Strength Validation:**
```javascript
export function validatePasswordStrength(password) {
  const minLength = 8;
  const hasUpperCase = /[A-Z]/.test(password);
  const hasLowerCase = /[a-z]/.test(password);
  const hasNumber = /[0-9]/.test(password);
  const hasSpecialChar = /[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(password);
  
  const errors = [];
  if (password.length < minLength) {
    errors.push(`Password must be at least ${minLength} characters`);
  }
  if (!hasUpperCase) {
    errors.push('Password must contain uppercase letter');
  }
  if (!hasLowerCase) {
    errors.push('Password must contain lowercase letter');
  }
  if (!hasNumber) {
    errors.push('Password must contain number');
  }
  
  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
    strength: errors.length === 0 ? 'strong' : 'weak'
  };
}
```

---

#### 3. Authentication Endpoints

**POST /api/auth/register**

Register a new user with password hashing:

```javascript
// app/api/auth/register/route.js
import { hashPassword, validatePasswordStrength } from '@/lib/auth/password';
import { generateToken } from '@/lib/auth/jwt';
import { sendSuccess, sendError, ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/responseHandler';

export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const { email, name, password, role = 'Member' } = await request.json();
    
    // Validation
    if (!email || !name || !password) {
      return sendError(
        'Missing required fields: email, name, password',
        ERROR_CODES.MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS,
        400
      );
    }
    
    // Password strength check
    const passwordCheck = validatePasswordStrength(password);
    if (!passwordCheck.isValid) {
      return sendError(
        'Weak password',
        ERROR_CODES.VALIDATION_ERROR,
        400,
        { errors: passwordCheck.errors }
      );
    }
    
    // Hash password
    const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password);
    
    // Create user
    const user = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email,
        name,
        password: hashedPassword,
        role,
        avatar: generateAvatarColor()
      },
      select: {
        id: true,
        email: true,
        name: true,
        role: true,
        avatar: true,
        createdAt: true
      }
    });
    
    // Generate JWT token
    const token = generateToken(user);
    
    // Create session record
    await prisma.session.create({
      data: {
        token,
        userId: user.id,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 24 hours
      }
    });
    
    return sendSuccess(
      { user, token },
      'Registration successful',
      201
    );
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'P2002') {
      return sendError(
        'Email already registered',
        ERROR_CODES.DUPLICATE_ENTRY,
        409
      );
    }
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "role": "Member",
      "avatar": "#3B82F6"
    },
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

---

**POST /api/auth/login**

Authenticate user and return JWT token:

```javascript
// app/api/auth/login/route.js
import { verifyPassword } from '@/lib/auth/password';
import { generateToken } from '@/lib/auth/jwt';

export async function POST(request) {

        'Email and password are required',
        ERROR_CODES.MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS,
        400
      );
    }
    
    // Find user
    const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({

    if (!user) {
      return sendError(
        'Invalid credentials',
        ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
        401
      );
    }
    
    // Verify password
    const isPasswordValid = await verifyPassword(password, user.password);
    
    if (!isPasswordValid) {
      return sendError(
        'Invalid credentials',
        ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
        401
      );
    }
    
    // Generate token
    const token = generateToken(user);
    
    // Create session
    await prisma.session.create({
      data: {
        token,
        userId: user.id,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
      }
    });
    
    // Remove password from response
    const { password: _, ...userWithoutPassword } = user;
    
    return sendSuccess(
      { user: userWithoutPassword, token },
      'Login successful'
    );
  } catch (error) {
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const token = request.headers.get('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
    
    if (!token) {
      return sendError(
        'No token provided',
        ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
        401
      );
    }

      null,
      'Logout successful'
    );
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === 'P2025') {
      // Session not found (already logged out)
      return sendSuccess(null, 'Already logged out');
    }
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

    if (!token) {
      return sendError(
        'No token provided',
        ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
        401
      );
    }
    
    // Verify JWT

    return sendError(
      'Invalid token',
      ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
      401
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### 4. Authentication Middleware

**File:** `lib/middleware/auth.js`

```javascript
import { verifyToken } from '@/lib/auth/jwt';
import { sendError, ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/responseHandler';
import prisma from '@/lib/db';

export async function authenticateRequest(request) {
  const token = request.headers.get('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  
  if (!token) {
    throw new Error('NO_TOKEN');
  }
  
  // Verify JWT
  const decoded = verifyToken(token);
  
  // Verify session
  const session = await prisma.session.findUnique({
    where: { token },
    include: { user: true }
  });
  
  if (!session || new Date() > session.expiresAt) {
    throw new Error('INVALID_SESSION');
  }
  
  return session.user;
}

export function requireAuth(handler) {
  return async function(request, context) {
    try {
      const user = await authenticateRequest(request);
      
      // Attach user to request
      request.user = user;
      
      return await handler(request, context);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.message === 'NO_TOKEN') {
        return sendError(
          'Authentication required',
          ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
          401
        );
      }
      if (error.message === 'INVALID_SESSION') {
        return sendError(
          'Session expired or invalid',
          ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
          401
        );
      }
      return sendError(
        'Authentication failed',
        ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
        401
      );
    }
  };
}
```

---

#### 5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Authorization Middleware:**

```javascript
// lib/middleware/authorize.js
import { sendError, ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/responseHandler';

export function requireRole(...allowedRoles) {
  return function(handler) {
    return async function(request, context) {
      const user = request.user; // Set by requireAuth middleware
      
      if (!user) {
        return sendError(
          'Authentication required',
          ERROR_CODES.UNAUTHORIZED,
          401
        );
      }
      
      if (!allowedRoles.includes(user.role)) {
        return sendError(
          `Access denied. Required role: ${allowedRoles.join(' or ')}`,
          ERROR_CODES.FORBIDDEN,
          403,
          { userRole: user.role, requiredRoles: allowedRoles }
        );
      }
      
      return await handler(request, context);
    };
  };
}
```

**Usage in Protected Routes:**

```javascript
// app/api/users/route.js (Protected)
import { requireAuth } from '@/lib/middleware/auth';
import { requireRole } from '@/lib/middleware/authorize';

// Only Admins and Owners can list all users
export const GET = requireAuth(requireRole('Admin', 'Owner')(
  async function(request) {
    try {
      const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
      return sendSuccess(users, 'Users fetched successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      return handlePrismaError(error);
    }
  }
));

// Only Admins and Owners can create users
export const POST = requireAuth(requireRole('Admin', 'Owner')(
  async function(request) {
    // ... create user logic
  }
));
```

```javascript
// app/api/tasks/route.js (Partially Protected)

// Anyone can view tasks (public)
export async function GET(request) {
  const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany();
  return sendSuccess(tasks);
}

// Only authenticated users can create tasks
export const POST = requireAuth(async function(request) {
  const { title, description } = await request.json();
  const task = await prisma.task.create({
    data: {
      title,
      description,
      creatorId: request.user.id // From auth middleware
    }
  });
  return sendSuccess(task, 'Task created', 201);
});
```

---

#### 6. Session Management

**Session Model:**
```prisma
model Session {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  token     String   @unique
  userId    String
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  expiresAt DateTime
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  @@index([token])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

**Session Cleanup (Expired Sessions):**
```javascript
// lib/auth/session-cleanup.js
export async function cleanupExpiredSessions() {
  const result = await prisma.session.deleteMany({
    where: {
      expiresAt: {
        lt: new Date() // Less than current time
      }
    }
  });
  
  console.log(`Cleaned up ${result.count} expired sessions`);
  return result.count;
}

// Run as cron job or API endpoint
// GET /api/auth/cleanup-sessions
export async function GET() {
  const count = await cleanupExpiredSessions();
  return sendSuccess({ deletedCount: count }, 'Sessions cleaned up');
}
```

#### Automated Test Script

**File:** `scripts/test-auth-flow.js`

```javascript
async function testAuthFlow() {
  console.log('🔐 Testing Authentication Flow\n');
  
  // Step 1: Register
  console.log('1️⃣  Register new user...');
  const registerRes = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: `test_${Date.now()}@example.com`,
      name: 'Test User',
      password: 'SecurePass123!',
      role: 'Member'
    })
  });
  const registerData = await registerRes.json();
  console.log('✅ Registration:', registerData.success ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  
  const token = registerData.data?.token;
  
  // Step 2: Access protected route
  console.log('\n2️⃣  Access protected route...');
  const meRes = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  const meData = await meRes.json();
  console.log('✅ Protected route:', meData.success ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  
  // Step 3: Test role-based access (should fail for Member)
  console.log('\n3️⃣  Test role-based access control...');

    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  const usersData = await usersRes.json();
  console.log('✅ RBAC working:', !usersData.success && usersData.error?.code === 'E008' ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  
  // Step 4: Logout
  console.log('\n4️⃣  Logout...');
  const logoutRes = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  const logoutData = await logoutRes.json();
  console.log('✅ Logout:', logoutData.success ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  
  // Step 5: Verify token invalidated
  console.log('\n5️⃣  Verify token invalidated...');
  const invalidRes = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  const invalidData = await invalidRes.json();
  console.log('✅ Token invalidated:', !invalidData.success ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  
  console.log('\n✅ All authentication tests passed!');
}

testAuthFlow();
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented

#### 1. Password Security

✅ **Bcrypt Hashing** - 12 rounds (industry standard)  
✅ **Password Strength Validation** - Min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number  
✅ **No Plain Text Storage** - Passwords always hashed before storage  
✅ **Secure Password Reset** - Token-based reset flow (future enhancement)

#### 2. Token Security

✅ **JWT with HS256** - HMAC with SHA-256 signature  
✅ **Secret Key Management** - Stored in environment variables  
✅ **Token Expiration** - 24-hour lifespan, configurable  
✅ **Session Validation** - Double-check token + database session

#### 3. API Protection

✅ **Authorization Header** - Standard Bearer token format  
✅ **Middleware Pattern** - Reusable auth/authorization logic  
✅ **Role-Based Access** - Granular permissions (Owner, Admin, Member)  
✅ **Error Messages** - No leakage of sensitive info (e.g., "user exists")

#### 4. Session Management

✅ **Database Sessions** - Track active sessions for invalidation  
✅ **Cascade Delete** - User deletion removes all sessions  
✅ **Expiration Cleanup** - Automatic expired session removal  
✅ **Single Device Limit** - Optional: can enforce one active session

---

### Common Security Vulnerabilities Prevented

| Vulnerability | Prevention Method |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Prisma ORM parameterized queries |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Next.js auto-escapes output |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | JWT tokens (not cookies), future: CSRF tokens |
| **Brute Force Attacks** | Rate limiting (future: implement with Redis) |
| **Session Fixation** | Generate new token on login |
| **Weak Passwords** | Password strength validation |
| **Token Leakage** | HTTPS enforced, tokens in headers (not URL) |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Role-based middleware checks |

---

### DAY 12 - MOHIT
## Zod Schema Validation & Request Validation

### 📋 Overview

Implemented comprehensive request validation using Zod schemas across all API endpoints. Zod provides type-safe validation with clear error messages, improving data integrity and developer experience.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Type-safe validation with runtime checks
- ✅ Clear, descriptive error messages for clients
- ✅ Schema reusability between client and server
- ✅ Automatic type inference (TypeScript-ready)
- ✅ Composable and extensible validation rules
- ✅ Custom refinements for complex business logic

---

### 📂 Schema Files Structure

---

### 1️⃣ User Schema (`lib/schemas/userSchema.js`)

#### Create User Schema
Used for `POST /api/users`

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";

export const createUserSchema = z.object({
  email: z
    .string()
    .email("Invalid email address")
    .min(1, "Email is required"),
  
  name: z
    .string()
    .min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters long")
    .max(100, "Name must not exceed 100 characters"),
  
  password: z
    .string()
    .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters long")
    .max(100, "Password must not exceed 100 characters")
    .regex(
      /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/,
      "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number"
    ),
  
  role: z
    .enum(["Owner", "Admin", "Member"], {
      errorMap: () => ({ message: "Role must be Owner, Admin, or Member" })
    })
    .optional()
    .default("Member"),
  
  avatar: z
    .string()
    .url("Avatar must be a valid URL")
    .optional()
    .nullable(),
});

### 2.20 Objective — JWT Auth

#### Flow
1. Signup (`POST /api/auth/signup`): validate input, hash password with bcrypt, store user, issue JWT.
2. Login (`POST /api/auth/login`): validate input, verify password with bcrypt.compare, issue JWT with `userId` and `email`.
3. Protected route (`GET /api/users`): check `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, reject if missing/invalid/expired.

#### Key Files
- [lib/auth.js](lib/auth.js) — JWT sign/verify and request authentication helper.
- [lib/schemas/authSchema.js](lib/schemas/authSchema.js) — Zod schemas for signup/login.
- [app/api/auth/signup/route.ts](app/api/auth/signup/route.ts) — signup handler (hash + create user + token).
- [app/api/auth/login/route.ts](app/api/auth/login/route.ts) — login handler (verify + token).
- [app/api/users/route.js](app/api/users/route.js) — protected route using Bearer token.

#### Bcrypt & JWT Usage
```typescript
// Hash password before storing
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

// Generate JWT with user id/email
const token = signAuthToken({ userId: user.id, email: user.email, role: user.role });

// Guard a route with Bearer token
const authResult = authenticateRequest(request);
if (authResult.errorResponse) {
  return authResult.errorResponse;
}
```

#### Sample Responses
Signup success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Signup successful",
  "data": { "user": { "id": "...", "email": "alice@example.com" }, "token": "<jwt>" },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

Duplicate email (signup)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "User with this email already exists",
  "error": { "code": "E102" },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

Invalid credentials (login)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid email or password",
  "error": { "code": "E103" },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

Missing/invalid token (protected route)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Authorization header missing or invalid",
  "error": { "code": "E007" },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Token Expiry, Refresh, Storage
- Tokens expire in `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (defaults to 1h); rotate secrets per environment with `JWT_SECRET`.
- Refresh strategy (future): issue long-lived refresh token in an httpOnly, secure cookie; rotate on use; revoke on logout.
- Storage options: prefer httpOnly cookies for XSS resistance; if using localStorage, mitigate with strict Content Security Policy and short-lived access tokens. Always send tokens via `Authorization: Bearer` headers, never in URLs.

#### Security Impact
- Bcrypt hashing prevents leaked DB credentials from being usable.
- JWT verification blocks unauthorized access to protected data.
- Clear error codes/messages make client handling predictable without revealing sensitive details.

---

### 🔧 Key Implementation Details

#### 1. Password Hashing (Signup)

```javascript
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";

// Hash password before storing
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: { name, email, password: hashedPassword },
});
```

**Security:** Uses bcrypt with 10 salt rounds (industry standard). Plain-text passwords never stored.

---

#### 2. JWT Token Generation

```javascript
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || "dev-secret";
const JWT_EXPIRES_IN = process.env.JWT_EXPIRES_IN || "1h";

export const signAuthToken = (payload) => {
  return jwt.sign(payload, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: JWT_EXPIRES_IN });
};

// Usage
const token = signAuthToken({ 
  userId: user.id, 
  email: user.email, 
  role: user.role 
});
```

**Payload includes:** userId, email, role — minimal data to avoid token bloat.

---

#### 3. Password Verification (Login)

```javascript
// Compare plain-text password with hashed password
const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

if (!isPasswordValid) {
  return sendError("Invalid email or password", ERROR_CODES.INVALID_CREDENTIALS, 401);
}
```

**Security:** Generic error message prevents username enumeration.

---

#### 4. Protected Route Middleware

```javascript
import { authenticateRequest } from "@/lib/auth";

export async function GET(request) {
  // Verify JWT token
  const authResult = authenticateRequest(request);
  if (authResult.errorResponse) {
    return authResult.errorResponse; // 401 Unauthorized
  }

  // authResult.user contains decoded token data
  const { userId, email, role } = authResult.user;

  // Proceed with authorized logic
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  return sendSuccess({ users }, "Users fetched successfully");
}
```

**Middleware checks:**
- Authorization header present
- Bearer token format
- Token signature valid
- Token not expired

---

---

### 🧪 Testing

Run automated authentication tests:

```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
npm run dev

# In another terminal
node scripts/test-auth.js
```

**Test coverage:**
1. ✅ Signup with valid data → creates user, returns token
2. ✅ Login with valid credentials → returns token
3. ✅ Protected route without token → 401 Unauthorized
4. ✅ Protected route with valid token → 200 Success
5. ✅ Login with invalid password → 401 Invalid credentials
6. ✅ Duplicate signup → 409 Conflict

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Password Storage** | Bcrypt hashing with 10 rounds (never plain-text) |
| **Password Strength** | Zod validation: min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number |
| **Token Signing** | HS256 algorithm with secret from environment |
| **Token Expiry** | Default 1 hour (configurable via JWT_EXPIRES_IN) |
| **Secret Management** | JWT_SECRET stored in .env (never committed) |
| **Error Messages** | Generic messages to prevent user enumeration |
| **Authorization Header** | Bearer token pattern (not in URL/query params) |
| **HTTPS** | Required in production to prevent token interception |

---

### 🔐 Token Storage Options

#### Option 1: localStorage (Current Implementation)

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- Works with all API requests
- Persists across browser sessions

**Cons:**
- Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Accessible to any JavaScript code

**Mitigation:**
- Keep token lifetime short (1h default)
- Implement CSP headers
- Sanitize all user inputs

---

#### Option 2: httpOnly Cookies (Recommended for Production)

**Pros:**
- Not accessible to JavaScript (XSS protection)
- Automatically sent with requests
- Can be secured with SameSite and Secure flags

**Cons:**
- Requires CSRF protection
- More complex logout flow

**Implementation (future):**
```javascript
// Server sets cookie
response.cookies.set('token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'strict',
  maxAge: 3600 // 1 hour
});
```

---

### 🔄 Token Refresh Strategy (Future Enhancement)

**Current:** Single access token with 1-hour expiry

**Recommended:**
1. **Access Token:** Short-lived (15 min), sent in Authorization header
2. **Refresh Token:** Long-lived (7 days), stored in httpOnly cookie
3. **Refresh Endpoint:** `/api/auth/refresh` to get new access token
4. **Logout:** Invalidate refresh token in database

**Benefits:**
- Limits exposure window if token is compromised
- Better user experience (no frequent re-login)
- Can revoke refresh tokens server-side

---

### 📊 Environment Variables

Add to `.env.development`:

```bash
# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET="dev-secret-key-change-in-production-minimum-32-characters"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1h"
```

**Production secrets:** Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`

---

### ✅ Implementation Checklist

- [x] Install jsonwebtoken package
- [x] Create JWT helper utilities (sign/verify)
- [x] Create Zod auth schemas (signup/login)
- [x] Implement signup API with bcrypt hashing
- [x] Implement login API with password verification
- [x] Add JWT middleware to protected routes
- [x] Create dark-themed signup page
- [x] Create dark-themed login page
- [x] Add JWT environment variables
- [x] Write automated test script
- [x] Document in README

---

### 🚀 Next Steps

**Enhancements to consider:**
1. **Email Verification** — Send confirmation email on signup
2. **Password Reset** — Forgot password flow with email token
3. **Refresh Tokens** — Long-lived tokens for better UX
4. **httpOnly Cookies** — More secure token storage
5. **Rate Limiting** — Prevent brute-force attacks
6. **2FA** — Two-factor authentication for admin accounts
7. **Session Management** — Track active sessions in database
8. **OAuth** — Social login (Google, GitHub)

---

### 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Never store plain-text passwords** — Always use bcrypt or similar
2. **Keep JWT payloads small** — Only essential data (userId, email, role)
3. **Use Bearer token pattern** — Standard Authorization header format
4. **Generic error messages** — Prevent username enumeration
5. **Environment-specific secrets** — Different JWT_SECRET per environment
6. **Short token lifetimes** — Reduce exposure window
7. **HTTPS in production** — Prevent token interception
8. **Validate on both sides** — Client for UX, server for security

### DAY 14 - MOHIT
## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Middleware

### 📋 Overview

Implemented comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system with middleware functions that validate JWT tokens and enforce role-based permissions across protected routes. Following the principle of least privilege, users only get access to resources appropriate for their role.

**What was implemented:**
- ✅ Role-based middleware helpers (`hasRole`, `requireRole`)
- ✅ Admin-only API routes (`/api/admin`, `/api/admin/users`)
- ✅ Three-tier role system (Owner, Admin, Member)
- ✅ Least privilege enforcement
- ✅ 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
- ✅ Automated RBAC testing script

### 📂 File Structure

**Middleware/Auth Utilities**
- [lib/auth.js](lib/auth.js) — Enhanced with `hasRole()` and `requireRole()` functions

**Admin Routes**
- [app/api/admin/route.js](app/api/admin/route.js) — Admin dashboard stats (Admin/Owner only)
- [app/api/admin/users/route.js](app/api/admin/users/route.js) — User management (Admin/Owner)

**Testing**
- [scripts/test-rbac.js](scripts/test-rbac.js) — Automated RBAC testing

---

### 🛠 Implementation Details

#### 1. Role Check Helper

```javascript
/**
 * Check if user has required role
 */
export const hasRole = (user, allowedRoles) => {
  if (!user || !user.role) return false;
  
  const roles = Array.isArray(allowedRoles) ? allowedRoles : [allowedRoles];
  return roles.includes(user.role);
};
```

**Usage:** Simple boolean check for role membership.

---

#### 2. Role-Based Middleware

```javascript
/**
 * Authenticate and require specific role(s)
 */
export const requireRole = (request, allowedRoles) => {
  // First authenticate
  const authResult = authenticateRequest(request);
  if (authResult.errorResponse) {
    return authResult; // 401 if not authenticated
  }

  // Check role
  if (!hasRole(authResult.user, allowedRoles)) {
    return {
      errorResponse: sendError(
        "Access denied. Insufficient permissions.",
        ERROR_CODES.FORBIDDEN,
        403
      ),
    };
  }

  return { user: authResult.user };
};
```

**Key features:**
- Validates JWT first (authentication)
- Then checks role (authorization)
- Returns 401 for missing/invalid token
- Returns 403 for insufficient permissions

---

#### 3. Admin Route Protection

```javascript
// app/api/admin/route.js
export async function GET(request) {
  // Require Admin or Owner role
  const authResult = requireRole(request, ["Admin", "Owner"]);
  if (authResult.errorResponse) {
    return authResult.errorResponse;
  }

  // Admin logic here...
  const stats = await fetchAdminStats();
  return sendSuccess(stats, "Admin statistics fetched");
}
```

**Single line of code** enforces role-based access!

---

#### 4. Owner-Only Actions

```javascript
// app/api/admin/route.js - Change user role
export async function POST(request) {
  // Only Owners can change roles
  const authResult = requireRole(request, "Owner");
  if (authResult.errorResponse) {
    return authResult.errorResponse;
  }

  // Update user role...
}
```

**Highest privilege level** for sensitive operations.

---

### 🧪 Testing RBAC

Run the automated test script:

```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
npm run dev

# In another terminal
node scripts/test-rbac.js
```

**Test scenarios:**
1. ✅ Member user can access `/api/users`
2. ✅ Member user denied access to `/api/admin` (403)
3. ✅ Unauthenticated request denied (401)
4. ✅ Member user denied access to `/api/admin/users` (403)

---

### 📝 API Examples

#### ✅ Member Access to /api/users (Allowed)

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MEMBER_JWT>"
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Users fetched successfully",
  "data": {

### 🎯 Principle of Least Privilege

**Definition:** Each user should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.

**Implementation in our system:**

| Role | Can Access | Cannot Access |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Member** | Own tasks, assigned tasks, comments | Admin routes, other users' data |
| **Admin** | User management, system stats, all tasks | Role changes, user deletion |
| **Owner** | Everything (full control) | N/A |

**Benefits:**
- **Security** — Limits damage from compromised accounts
- **Compliance** — Meets regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2)
- **Auditability** — Clear accountability for actions
- **Simplicity** — Users see only relevant features

---

### 🔄 Adding New Roles

The system is designed for easy role extension:

**Example: Add "Editor" role**

1. **Update Prisma schema:**
```prisma
role String @default("Member") // Owner, Admin, Editor, Member
```

2. **Define permissions:**
```javascript
// lib/permissions.js
export const PERMISSIONS = {
  Owner: ['*'], // All permissions
  Admin: ['users:read', 'users:update', 'tasks:*', 'stats:read'],
  Editor: ['tasks:*', 'comments:*'],
  Member: ['tasks:read', 'tasks:update:own', 'comments:*'],
};
```

3. **Protect routes:**
```javascript
const authResult = requireRole(request, ["Admin", "Editor"]);
```

**That's it!** The middleware handles the rest.

---

### ⚠️ Security Risks Without RBAC

**If middleware checks were missing or incorrect:**

1. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Member users could access admin endpoints
   - Read sensitive data (all user emails, passwords hashes)
   - Modify other users' data

2. **Data Breach**
   - Unauthorized access to PII
   - GDPR/compliance violations
   - Legal liability

3. **System Manipulation**
   - Delete users or tasks
   - Change roles (make self admin)
   - Corrupt data integrity

4. **Business Impact**
   - Loss of customer trust
   - Financial penalties
   - Reputational damage

**Example attack scenario:**
```bash
# Without RBAC, any authenticated user could:
DELETE /api/admin/users?id=<ANY_USER_ID>
# → Delete any user in the system!
```

---

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Defense in Depth** | Multiple layers: JWT validation → Role check → Business logic |
| **Fail Secure** | Deny access by default, allow only with explicit permission |
| **Clear Errors** | Different status codes for auth (401) vs authorization (403) |
| **Audit Logging** | Log all admin actions (future enhancement) |
| **Role in Token** | Include role in JWT for stateless checks |
| **Regular Review** | Periodically audit role assignments |

---

### 📊 Response Codes

| Code | Meaning | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **200** | OK | Successful request with required role |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Missing, invalid, or expired token |
| **403** | Forbidden | Valid token but insufficient role |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |

**Key distinction:**
- **401** = "Who are you?" (authentication)
- **403** = "I know who you are, but you can't do that" (authorization)

---

### ✅ Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add role field to User model (Prisma)
- [x] Create `hasRole()` helper function
- [x] Create `requireRole()` middleware
- [x] Implement admin-only routes
- [x] Test with different role levels
- [x] Return proper HTTP status codes (401 vs 403)
- [x] Write automated RBAC tests
- [x] Document middleware flow
- [x] Document security implications

---

### 🚀 Next Steps

**Enhancements to consider:**

1. **Permission-Based Access Control (PBAC)**
   - Fine-grained permissions beyond roles
   - E.g., `tasks:create`, `users:delete`, `settings:write`

2. **Resource-Level Authorization**
   - Users can only edit own tasks
   - Admins can edit any task in their team

3. **Dynamic Roles**
   - Create custom roles via admin UI
   - Assign permissions per role

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all admin actions
   - Track who accessed what, when

5. **Rate Limiting per Role**
   - Members: 100 req/hour
   - Admins: 1000 req/hour

6. **Time-Based Access**
   - Temporary elevated permissions
   - Auto-revoke after duration

---

### 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Authentication ≠ Authorization** — Knowing who you are vs what you can do
2. **Deny by default** — Explicit allow is safer than explicit deny
3. **Role in JWT** — Enables stateless authorization checks
4. **Separate concerns** — Auth middleware → Role check → Business logic
5. **Clear error codes** — 401 for auth, 403 for authz
6. **Least privilege** — Minimize access, maximize security
7. **Extensible design** — Easy to add new roles/permissions
8. **Test thoroughly** — RBAC bugs can be catastrophic

### 🛠 Implementation Details

#### 1. Custom Error Classes

```javascript
/**
 * Custom error classes for common scenarios
 */

// Validation errors (e.g., Zod validation failures)
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message, details = null) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ValidationError';
    this.statusCode = 400;
    this.details = details;
  }
}

// Database errors (e.g., Prisma errors)
class DatabaseError extends Error {
  constructor(message, originalError = null) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'DatabaseError';
    this.statusCode = 500;
    this.originalError = originalError;
  }
}

// Unauthorized access
class UnauthorizedError extends Error {
  constructor(message = 'Unauthorized') {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'UnauthorizedError';
    this.statusCode = 401;
  }
}

// Forbidden access
class ForbiddenError extends Error {
  constructor(message = 'Access denied') {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ForbiddenError';
    this.statusCode = 403;
  }
}

// Resource not found
class NotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(resource = 'Resource') {
    super(`${resource} not found`);
    this.name = 'NotFoundError';
    this.statusCode = 404;
  }
}
```

**Why custom error classes?**
- Type-safe error identification
- Automatic status code mapping
- Consistent error structure
- Easy to extend with new error types

---

#### 2. Centralized Error Handler

```javascript
/**
 * Central error handler
 * Processes errors and returns appropriate response based on environment
 */
export function handleError(error, context = '') {
  const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  
  // Log the error
  logError(error, { context });
  
  // Determine status code and message
  let statusCode = 500;
  let errorMessage = 'Something went wrong';
  let errorDetails = null;
  
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    statusCode = 400;
    errorMessage = error.message;
    errorDetails = error.details;
  } else if (error instanceof UnauthorizedError) {
    statusCode = 401;
    errorMessage = error.message;
  } else if (error instanceof ForbiddenError) {
    statusCode = 403;
    errorMessage = error.message;
  } else if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    statusCode = 404;
    errorMessage = error.message;
  } else if (error instanceof DatabaseError) {
    statusCode = 500;
    errorMessage = 'Database error occurred';
  } else if (error instanceof ZodError) {
    statusCode = 400;
    errorMessage = 'Validation failed';
    errorDetails = error.errors;
  }
  
  // Build error response
  const errorResponse = {
    success: false,
    error: {
      message: isDevelopment ? errorMessage : 'Something went wrong',
      code: error.name || 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
    },
  };
  
  // In development, include full details and stack trace
  if (isDevelopment) {
    if (errorDetails) {
      errorResponse.error.details = errorDetails;
    }
    errorResponse.error.stack = error.stack;
  }
  
  return sendError(
    errorResponse.error.message,
    error.name || 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
    statusCode
  );
}
```

**Key features:**
- Environment-aware responses
- Automatic error type detection
- Structured error logging
- Stack traces in development only

---

#### 3. Structured Logging

```javascript
/**
 * Format log entry with metadata
 */
function formatLog(level, message, meta = {}) {
  return JSON.stringify({
    level,
    message,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
    ...meta,
  });
}

/**
 * Log error with context
 */
export function logError(error, meta = {}) {
  const errorLog = formatLog('error', error.message, {
    ...meta,
    errorName: error.name,
    stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? error.stack : undefined,
  });
  console.error(errorLog);
}

/**
 * Log API request
 */
export function logRequest(request, route) {
  const requestLog = formatLog('info', 'API Request', {
    route,
    method: request.method,
    url: request.url,
  });
  console.log(requestLog);
}

/**
 * Log API response
 */
export function logResponse(request, response, statusCode) {
  const responseLog = formatLog('info', 'API Response', {
    route: request.url,
    method: request.method,
    statusCode,
  });
  console.log(responseLog);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Structured JSON logs (easy to parse)
- Timestamps for debugging
- Environment metadata
- Request/response tracking
- Production-safe (no sensitive data)

---

#### 4. Route Integration Example

**Before (app/api/users/route.js):**
```javascript
export async function GET(request) {
  try {
    // ... business logic
    return sendSuccess(data, "Users fetched");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("GET /api/users error:", error);
    
    if (error instanceof ZodError) {
      return handleZodError(error);
    }
    return handlePrismaError(error);
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
export async function GET(request) {
  try {
    logRequest(request, "GET /api/users");
    
    // ... business logic
    
    const response = sendSuccess(data, "Users fetched");
    logResponse(request, response, 200);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    return handleError(error, "GET /api/users");
  }
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Single error handler (instead of multiple)
- Request/response logging
- Consistent error format
- Less code duplication

---

### 🧪 Testing Error Scenarios

Test endpoint simulates different error types:

```bash
# Database error
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-error?type=database

# Validation error
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-error?type=validation

# Not found error
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-error?type=notfound

# Unauthorized error
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-error?type=unauthorized

# Generic error
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-error?type=generic
```

**Development mode response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Database connection failed",
    "code": "DatabaseError",
    "stack": "DatabaseError: Database connection failed\n    at GET (/app/api/test-error/route.js:15:11)\n    ..."
  }
}
```

**Production mode response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Something went wrong",
    "code": "DatabaseError"
  }
}
```

---

### 📊 Error Response Comparison

| **Aspect** | **Development** | **Production** |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Error message | Detailed, specific | Generic "Something went wrong" |
| Stack trace | ✅ Included | ❌ Hidden |
| Error details | ✅ Full details | ❌ Minimal info |
| Validation errors | ✅ Field-specific | ❌ Generic message |
| Security | Lower (for debugging) | ✅ High (no leaks) |

---

### 📝 Example Log Output

**Development mode:**
```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T10:30:45.123Z",
  "environment": "development",
  "context": "GET /api/users",
  "errorName": "DatabaseError",
  "stack": "DatabaseError: Database connection failed\n    at GET (/app/api/users/route.js:25:11)"
}
```

**Production mode:**
```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T10:30:45.123Z",
  "environment": "production",
  "context": "GET /api/users",
  "errorName": "DatabaseError"
}
```

---
